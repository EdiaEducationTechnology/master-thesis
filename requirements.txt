To run the client and server, a few packages are needed that aren't included in most Python distributions, and these need to be installed before running. These are (with versions I am currently on) nltk==3.5 (for tokenizing, lemmatizing etc.), transformers==4.3.2 (for BERT), grpcio==1.37.1 (for client-server communication) and torch==1.7.1.
