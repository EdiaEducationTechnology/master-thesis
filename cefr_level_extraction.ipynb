April begins on the same day of week as \"July\" in all years and also \"January\" in leap years. April\\'s flower is the Sweet Pea and its birthstone is the Diamond. The meaning of the Diamond is Innocence. April in poetry. Poets use \"April\" to mean the end of winter. For example: \"April showers bring May flowers.\"'"
