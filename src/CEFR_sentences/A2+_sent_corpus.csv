"My story is about one such lass: young Grace Barry."
"Our Captain Cutthroat spotted a merchant ship sailing into the bay."
"There's more crew for us."
"D'you think they'd like to join us, lads?'"
"Bert Bunce, the bosun, brought some of the sailors before the captain."
"All had to serve on board our pirate ship."
"This is a pirate ship."
"We don't allow girls on board."
"That's for bringing girls on my ship!"
"And since you brought me on board, death to you!'"
"Cutthroat was lost for words."
"He swore into his black beard and at Bert Bunce."
"Can't you tell a girl from a boy?"
"She's Grace - dis-Grace more like it!"
"Now what are we going to do?'"
"We all muttered among ourselves."
"Rules were rules, after all."
"Grace watched calmly as we all argued."
"Some were for tossing her overboard."
"I was against it."
"It didn't seem right to kill the poor girl."
"It wasn't her fault she was on a pirate ship."
"But Captain Cutthroat was set on getting rid of her."
"He couldn't forgive her for making him look a fool."
"Grace was taken down below, while the captain shouted orders."
"Waves reared their foaming heads, blinding rain poured down."
"The boat rolled and heaved."
"I don't recall much about that night."
"I do remember seeing the watchman snoring in a pool of rum."
"And no one was at the wheel."
"I don't suppose any of us could stand, let alone steer."
"We might well have sunk to a watery grave had not someone taken charge."
"The sailor began to shout orders."
"More tack on the jib!"
"So the young sailor scrambled up to the top of the mast."
"There, swaying in the gale, he cut free the tangled sail."
"All the while, the ship pitched and tossed in the towering seas."
"And he steered the ship safely through the waves."
"Whoever he was, he was a born sailor."
"It was a calm, grey morning when we finally staggered on deck."
"Quite a few of us were sick and holding our aching heads."
"He was nowhere to be seen."
"Yet no one came forward."
"In the distance we could dimly make out a green island and sandy bay."
"Just the spot for unwanted girl pirates."
"He gave a cruel laugh."
"Now, though we were scared of Cutthroat, we weren't all cowards."
"I couldn't help myself."
"Even if she makes land, she'll starve to death."
"Let's leave her be."
"We could drop her at the next port.'"
"Cutthroat would have none of it."
"But Grace was not going to give in without a fight."
"She gave me a grateful look."
"At that Cutthroat snatched his cutlass out of his belt."
"That girl goes into the water."
"I bit my tongue."
"She hit the sea like a sack of herring tails."
"Some of the crew laughed and jeered as they watched the race for shore."
"Grace was swimming a leg's length ahead of the sharks."
"But not all of us were laughing."
"Some of us were deeply ashamed."
"All at once, it came to me."
"I knew I'd seen those baggy breeches before!"
"Of course, it was the bold sailor from the previous night."
"I whispered, willing her to escape the sharks."
"She just made land as a shark's jaws snapped shut on her sandal."
"Her shouts came to us on the wind."
"You'll live to remember Grace Barry!'"
"Years later, she told me about it."
"This is her story, if I remember rightly."
"She lay there for a couple of hours."
"But it was never her way to stay down for long."
"She staggered to her feet and started to explore."
"Straight away she saw that there were banana, coconut and date palms."
"Now, at least, she had food."
"Soon she had also piled up dates and yellow-green bananas."
"But besides food she needed somewhere safe to sleep."
"First she combed the beach for wood."
"The dried seaweed and grasses covered her floor."
"She used wood for the walls, slanted like a tent."
"Then she tied banana leaves over the cracks with coconut fibre."
"The sun was hanging low over the sea."
"She was stiff and sore - and very hungry."
"Maybe I'll find some company.'"
"Little did she know she already had some!"
"Someone was watching her even as she fell asleep."
"What was that noise outside?"
"Suddenly, she heard it again."
"Someone was moving about outside the hut."
"They were creeping up on her - no doubt to slit her throat!"
"Grabbing her only sandal, she sat up, her heart in her mouth."
"All of a sudden she had an idea."
"It was worth a try."
"Several minutes later, blue-grey smoke began to drift upwards."
"This was followed by a sudden burst of flame."
"Then I can tie them to string twisted from palm fibre."
"And I'll stick a bit of crab on the hook as bait."
"There's my fishing line!'"
"An hour or so later she was standing on a rock above the sea."
"Then she strung them across her barbecue."
"A delicious smell of grilled fish floated across the sand and into the trees."
"There were two shadowy figures among the palm trees."
"If you want food, come and get it.'"
"Slowly but surely, the goats came to eat out of her hand."
"After that, they visited her every day for scraps to eat."
"So now she had a regular supply of goat's milk."
"One dark night, the skies opened and the rains came down."
"She seemed to have all she needed."
"But even with her two goats, she was lonely."
"Not once had she spotted a passing sail."
"Or even the rest of her life?"
"It did not bear thinking about."
"One day she made a grim discovery."
"It was while she was exploring a new part of the island."
"There lay a skeleton."
"The forefinger of its left hand was pointing to the grassy bank opposite."
"Inside she found a piece of paper with faded writing on it."
"She glanced round, following the line from finger to bank."
"Then she prodded the soil with a stick until she struck something hard."
"Brushing away the loose earth, she eased a wooden chest from its grave."
"Her heart beat faster with excitement."
"Yet nothing could have prepared her for what was inside the chest."
"The sight was dazzling."
"Rubies and pearls gleamed amidst glittering piles of gold coins."
"Then she let the rubies and pearls trickle through her fingers like running water."
"The least I can do is bury his bones.'"
"But imagine her horror when the skull came apart from the body."
"For the moment, however, she stood there in silence."
"She was thinking of Ben's lonely fate."
"Was this what awaited her?"
"Each palm tree along the shore was a week."
"She was already on her thirty-third tree."
"Just as quickly it sank down to her feet."
"For there was the skull and crossbones fluttering from the ship's mast."
"It was the hated Sea Devil, the cause of all her troubles!"
"Were the pirates returning to make sure she was dead?"
"Maybe Cutthroat could not risk her giving evidence against him."
"There was nowhere to hide."
"We'd been sailing about lost for days."
"Suddenly I saw the island - and it looked sort of familiar."
"One of the lads cried, That's it!"
"That's where our bad luck began.'"
"And we knew we'd come back to where Cutthroat had thrown Grace overboard."
"Was she still alive?"
"Our ship dropped anchor off shore."
"I sat in a longboat with two other pirates and headed for land."
"When we reached the island I stepped forward to greet Grace."
"I could see the poor girl thought we had come to kill her."
"The men sent me for you."
"I could see the surprise on her face."
"But she still didn't trust me."
"So I told her the whole story."
"After we left you we drank away all our booty."
"Then we got caught by the Navy."
"We were lucky not to hang."
"We escaped but we're lost and most of the crew's sick."
"She stared hard at me."
"Grace smiled to herself."
"Shall I take charge of these men?"
"Or shall we let them stew in their own juice?'"
"One goat nodded wisely and waggled his beard."
"But you'll do as I say."
"Have your men carry my chest on board.'"
"Then she stepped quickly into the longboat."
"Once on board, Grace called all of us together."
"What a sorry sight we must have been!"
"In a calm, firm voice Grace spoke from the bridge."
"But... there'll be changes made."
"Why, you're just a pack of cowards."
"But would any of you survive a week on a desert island?'"
"Most of the men shuffled their feet nervously."
"Since I'm captain, I re-name this ship She Devil."
"Haul down the Jolly Roger and run up the Jolly Jane."
"That'll show who's boss."
"And we'll give half our booty to the poor along the coast."
"The rest we'll divide up fairly among the crew."
"There was a hush for a full minute."
"Then the men started muttering among themselves."
"After a while, we all fell silent."
"Then, we let out a roar in chorus."
"Grace grinned from ear to ear."
"So began Grace's new life as pirate captain."
"Almost at once we spotted a white sail in the distance."
"Along her sides were twenty cannons."
"He had spotted us and was now heading towards the She Devil."
"A buzz of excitement rose from end to end of our ship."

"It'll take some work, but I might be able to help.'"
"Uncle Hal wouldn't say any more."

"What could Uncle Hal do to help him get the part of Bugsy Malone?"
"Early on Sunday morning he rang Uncle Hal's doorbell."
"Uncle Hal showed Danny into the garage."

"Uncle Hal fetched two test tubes."
"In one was an inky green liquid, in the other some white powder."
"He measured a little from each carefully into a bottle."
"I call it my Personality Potion.'"
"Danny's eyes widened."
"You'll see.'"
"Uncle Hal mixed the potion in the bottle."
"It frothed and fizzed."
"He held it up to the lamp."

"Try it tomorrow,' said Uncle Hal."
"He opened the garage door."
"Do I seem different?"
"He took off the lid and sniffed it."

"A group of girls stood between Wicks and Danny."
"Wicks barged his way right through the middle, knocking one of them over."
"I've been looking for you.'"
"I told you to bring it today.'"
"Wicks held out his hand to Danny."
"You'd better have it.'"
"He was amazed at the words he'd just spoken."
"It must have been the potion speaking."
"Wicks' mouth was open but nothing was coming out."
"You can get lost.'"
"A crowd was gathering round them."
"Danny could see Laura and her friends at the front."
"Danny felt scared but also reckless."
"It was as if the potion had released a cork inside him."
"Wicks took hold of Danny's arm and started to twist."
"They couldn't believe their ears."
"He started to twist Danny's arm harder."
"Danny felt as if it was on fire."
"I think you should lay off the sweets, Wicks."
"Your teeth are going green.'"
"Everyone calls you Grotgums.'"
"Someone else took it up and soon the whole crowd was chanting: 'Grotgums!"
"Wicks stared round at them, his face as red as ketchup."
"He liked to pick on younger kids when they were alone."
"He wasn't used to facing a whole crowd shouting at him."
"The noise had reached a teacher who was heading that way."
"Wicks let go of Danny's arm and ran off."
"Danny watched him go."
"He had stood up to Wicks and survived."
"The potion really worked."
"People were staring at him in a new way."
"One of them was Laura."
"Thanks for starting that,' he said to her."
"Is your arm okay?'"
"Danny had forgotten his arm."
"I had to do something. '"
"At this point the bell went."
"He walked away feeling two metres tall."
"He had spoken to Laura Mills."
"After a whole year, he'd finally spoken to her."
"And she hadn't laughed at him, she'd talked back."
"Then he remembered -he'd said he was going to the audition."
"Even worse, he'd said he was going for the main part."
"The part of Bugsy."
"How could his mouth have landed him in so much trouble?"
"A lot of people had come to watch."
"They filled four rows of chairs."
"Laura Mills sat with her friend, Yasmin."
"Mark Shaw was there with his usual gang."
"Danny sat on his own."
"Sparrow hadn't come."
"He said he couldn't bear to see Danny make an idiot of himself."
"Danny was next but one to read."
"He fingered the potion nervously."
"The bottle felt hot and sticky."
"The last person before Danny was Wicks."
"He thought he was just the person to play a gangster."
"Mrs Morgan gave him a page of Bugsy to read."
"But Wicks was the world's worst actor."
"He read the lines as if it was the weather report."
"There were a few sniggers from the back rows."
"Wicks looked up furiously."
"That'll do Duncan, thank you,' said Mrs Morgan."
"Danny took a deep breath and stood up."
"He heard Mark Shaw whisper to his friends, 'Doolan?"
"This should be really funny.'"
"Danny looked down in horror at the green puddle by his feet."
"Then she pointed to the page."
"Danny tried to think about the words."
"But they seemed to swim around like tadpoles on the page."
"Without the Personality Potion, he knew he couldn't do it."
"He couldn't even speak."
"His throat was dry and his face was burning up."
"He made a sound like a car engine trying to start."
"Danny's gaze shifted to Laura Mills."
"She was glaring at Wicks."
"Then she looked straight at him and nodded."
"Why should she care that he was making an idiot of himself?"
"He shut his eyes."
"He tried to think how Kit Kane would have read the part."
"Then he took a deep breath and started to read."
"After a while he realized that the giggling from the back rows had stopped."
"The hall had gone quiet."
"And he was doing it!"
"The longer he went on, the better it sounded."
"She sounded really pleased."
"Danny went off in a daze to clear up the broken glass."
"Danny was surprised to see how nervous she looked."
"He gave her his best smile as she passed him."
"The truth A few days later, Danny stopped outside Uncle Hal's garage."
"He banged three times on the door."
"It lifted up and a hand pulled him inside."
"You're just in time!'"
"Turn the light on.'"
"But Uncle Hal took off Danny's glasses and replaced them with another pair."
"There was a click and two small beams of light lit up the room."
"You finished them!'"
"They just needed a little fine tuning,' said Uncle Hal proudly."
"That Personality Potion was amazing.'"
"Uncle Hal looked blank for a moment."
"Then his face lit up."
"You got the part in the play?'"
"I suppose I must have still been feeling the after-effects.'"
"What's so funny?'"
"He went into the kitchen and came back with two bottles."
"Inside them was the green liquid and the white powder."
"He showed Danny the labels."
"That gave it the fizz,' said Uncle Hal."
"That's all I put in the potion.'"
"Danny stared at the bottles in disbelief."
"There wasn't really a Personality Potion?'"
"Uncle Hal shook his head, still grinning."
"But really, you were just believing in yourself."
"There was no magic.'"
"He didn't know whether to be cross or pleased."
"He'd meant to ask Uncle Hal for more of the Personality Potion."

"Chapter 1 Everyone's Favourite Little Monster ""Oh, Denzil!"
"Denzil, you are disgusting!"
"And they both smiled at him admiringly."
"He knew he was disgusting."
"People often told him so."
"Every morning he stared happily at himself in the mirror."
"His hair was spiky his nose ran and his mouth dribbled."
"No wonder his mother and father adored him."
"No wonder his teacher, Miss Peabody, gave him lots of stars."
"He was everyone's favourite little monster."
"Until the day when it all began to go badly wrong."
"It started like any other day, with a really mucky, yucky breakfast."
"Denzil managed to get it all over everything."
"Suddenly, Mum turned pale."
"Donovan ..."" she said."
"Donovan, can you fetch my suitcase?"
"He was too busy slurping up his milk."
"Slurp, slurp, guzzle, BURP!"
"Did you hear that, Mum?"
"She just said, ""Go to school, Denzil."
"And she pushed him out of the house, without even kissing him goodbye."
"Puzzled, he made his way to school."
"There, to his relief, things got better again."
"The first lesson was Mucky Jokes."
"The other little monsters fell about laughing."
"Oh, Denzil,"" said Miss Peabody."
"That was the most disgusting joke I've ever heard!"
"She gave him four red stars, the highest mark you could get."
"The rest of the day wasn't bad, either."
"In the art lesson, they had to do a self-portrait."

"Chapter 2 Devora Her name was Devora."
"Dad took Denzil to see her at the hospital."
"She lay in a cot beside Mum's bed."
"Come and look at her,"" said Mum."
"Isn't she sweet?"
"Yes, thought Denzil, she was rather sweet."
"But he wasn't going to say so."
"Mum and Dad were gazing at her and making silly goo-goo noises."
"Who's Daddy's pride and joy then?"
"Denzil was shocked and hurt."
"That's what Dad had always called him."
"Yet, the baby had done nothing to deserve such praise."
"It just lay there, like a - well, like a baby."
"Suddenly she yawned - a yawn so enormous that Denzil stepped back hastily."
"The baby's mouth was like a deep, red cavern."
"He had never seen a mouth so huge."
"It seemed about twice the size of the rest of her body."
"Yet, when she shut it again, it looked quite normal."
"Give her to me,"" said Mum."
"I want to hold her."
"Gently, Dad lifted the baby out of the cot."
"He placed her in Mum's arms."
"The baby opened her eyes and smiled."
"Then she sicked up a whole lot of white stuff."
"What a clever girl!"
"I reckon she's going to be even more disgusting than Denzil."
"A cold, clammy fear took hold of Denzil."
"He stared at his baby sister."
"Devora dribbled and coughed."
"Was she really going to be worse than him?"
"Little Devora,"" said Mum, tenderly."
"The baby was all that anybody wanted to look at."
"Isn't she amazing!"
"Isn't she gorgeous!"
"Nobody took any notice of Denzil, at all."
"And Devora put on a real show for them."
"She was disgusting at the top end, forever dribbling and blowing raspberries."
"And she was even more disgusting at the bottom end."
"Denzil, would you like to hold your baby sister?"
"No, thanks,"" he said."
"Go on, take her,"" said Mum."
"She won't hurt you."
"She put the baby into his arms."
"Denzil stared down at Devora."
"Devora stared up at Denzil."
"Then she opened her mouth and screamed."
"Now, when Devora screamed, it was worse than when she yawned."
"At least, that's how it seemed to Denzil."
"And he was scared."
"He was so scared that he wanted to run away."
"Yet, he couldn't."
"Oh dear, I expect she's got a dirty nappy."
"You can help me change her."
"Denzil was stunned into silence."
"When it came to disgustingness, Devora beat him every time."
"How would he ever make people notice him again?"
"Chapter 4 Slugs and Slime and Slippery Fish Denzil thought and thought."
"He had to think of something brilliant."
"Something that would make Mum and Dad take notice of him again."
"At last he had an idea."
"Not snails, they weren't disgusting enough."
"He took them into the living room and tipped them on to the carpet."
"Look what I've got,"" he said, proudly."
"No one bothered to look."
"They were too busy gazing at Devora."
"She was lying on a blanket, kicking her legs and gurgling wetly."
"LOOK WHAT I'VE GOT,"" said Denzil in a louder voice."
"Lovely oozy, boozy, woozy slugs."
"Mum glanced at them briefly."
"Very nice,"" she said, and went back to admiring Devora."
"Look, Dad,"" said Denzil."
"They're leaving a slimy trail	^ all over the carpet."
"Mmm,"" said Dad, and went back to admiring Devora."
"Then Devora saw a slug slithering across the carpet towards her."
"A look of wonder and delight came over her face."
"She waited until the slug came closer."
"Then, quick as a flash, her fat little hand shot out."
"Go and find her some more, Denzil."
"Sadly, Denzil went back outside."
"His plan had failed."
"Once again, Devora had beaten him."
"At the bottom of the garden was a pond."
"It was a truly mucky pond, full of weeds and stinking slime."
"Denzil drew a deep breath and waded in with all his clothes on."
"Then he waded out again."
"Proudly, he went indoors."
"I fell in the water,"" he said."
"This wasn't true."
"Dad sniffed the air."
"What's that lovely pong?"
"Denzil puffed out his chest."
"No, it's Devora,"" said Mum."
"Her nappy needs changing again."
"Denzil's shoulders sagged with disappointment."
"At that moment, Devora saw him."
"She smiled and held out both her arms."
"Oh, the little love!"
"She wants you to pick her up, Denzil."
"I don't think it's Denzil she wants,"" said Dad."
"It's that fish poking out of his pocket."
"It must have got there while he was wading through the pond."
"He pulled it out and stared at it."
"Devora chuckled with delight."
"She got up from the floor and staggered towards him."
"Give her the fish, Denzil,"" said Dad."
"She deserves a reward."
"But Denzil didn't have time to give her the fish."
"She had already snatched it out of his hands."
"Next moment, she opened her huge mouth."
"She dropped the slimy slippery fish inside."
"Then she snapped her mouth shut and swallowed hard."
"Denzil couldn't speak."
"He had never felt so disgusted in his life."
"Her first real food!"
"She's growing up fast."
"She'll be talking next."
"Denzil's heart sank to the bottom of his squelchy boots."
"Nothing he could do would ever make his family admire him again."
"Sadly he turned around and walked out of the front door."
"Nobody even saw him go."
"Chapter 5 little Treasure Sadly, Denzil trudged along the street."
"Hello, Denzil,"" called out Mrs Wart."
"I hear you've got a new sister."
"Denzil couldn't even manage a smile."
"He shrugged and walked on."
"Hello, Denzil,"" called out Miss Peabody, his teacher."
"I hear your baby sister's growing up fast."
"She'll soon be ready to come to school."
"Denzil opened his mouth to speak, but no sound came out."
"The thought of Devora coming to school was too awful."
"You are lucky, having a new baby sister."
"I wish I had one."
"You can have mine,"" was what he wanted to say."
"But he didn't."
"He just shrugged and walked on."
"At last he came to the park."
"He sat down on a bench."
"Two large tears rolled down his cheeks."
"He was no longer the most disgusting little monster in Monster City."
"Only the brother of the most disgusting little monster in Monster City."
"Someone came to sit beside him."
"Denzil brushed away the tears."
"Mustn't let anyone see him crying."
"Then he realized who it was: Boastful Bertha."
"She was holding on to a pram."
"Denzil had had quite enough of babies, thanks very much."
"He got up to go."
"Look, Denzil,"" said Bertha."
"This is my baby brother."
"Isn't he disgusting?"
"Denzil glanced at the baby in the pram."
"It looked a pretty boring sort of baby, he thought."
"Not as disgusting as my baby sister,"" he said."
"The baby sicked up something revolting and green."
"Look at that,"" said Bertha."
"He's been eating grass."
"I bet your baby sister doesn't eat grass."
"She eats fish,"" said Denzil."
"The baby screwed up his eyes and made a very rude noise."
"He's got wind,"" said Bertha."
"I bet your baby sister doesn't make noises like that."
"They think there's a war going on."
"The baby's face turned red."
"He opened his mouth and screamed."
"Her mouth is bigger than a shark's."
"I bet she could swallow a whole person if she wanted to."
"Bertha stared at him."
"Come round to our house and have a look."
"Behind him, he heard the pram wheels squeaking as Bertha followed him home."
"Can Boastful Bertha have a look at Devora?"
"Yes, of course,"" said Mum."
"Is that your new baby brother, Bertha?"
"My, isn't he disgusting!"
"He's not so disgusting as Devora,"" said Denzil."
"And there was definitely a note of pride in his voice."
"They entered the living room."
"A crowd stood around Devora, gazing at her admiringly."
"They made way for Denzil and Bertha, who was carrying her baby brother."
"When Bertha's baby brother saw Devora, he opened his mouth and screamed."
"Devora looked up in surprise."
"Then she, too, opened her mouth and screamed."
"Everyone drew back hastily, covering their ears."
"Bertha's baby brother stopped screaming."
"He clutched her tightly."
"Bertha stared down at Devora's huge mouth."
"It was getting bigger and bigger with every scream."
"Bertha turned and fled."
"As soon as the other baby had gone, Devora stopped screaming."
"She closed her mouth and smiled."
"Denzil nearly burst with pride."
"Devora was far, far more disgusting than Bertha's baby brother."
"And her very first word had been his name."
"Den - zil,"" Devora said again, loudly and clearly."
"Den - zil, Den - zil, Den - zil."
"She held out both hands, waggling her short fat fingers."
"Look at that,"" sighed everyone."
"How she loves her big brother!"
"I think she wants something,"" he said."
"Slugs, I expect,"" he said."
"The others have all wriggled away."
"I'll fetch her some more."

"It shouldn't matter how big I am!"
"The dinosaurs stood in a line."

"I don't suppose you want my help."
"I'm only a little mouthful."
"I'll do anything you want."
"Anything,"" spluttered Tyro."
"Do you promise to leave our valley and never come back?"
"I promise,"" gurgled Tyro."
"Just get me out of this water."
"All right, then,"" said Cosmo."
"He stamped his foot on the island."

"They always went to work on Saturday mornings."
"There were boxes everywhere."
"Harry was taking a bed apart."

"I can't leave Ada and Harry."
"Dogs stay with their owners."
"Not like some cats I know."
"They'll go anywhere for a warm fire.'"

"There was a big orange bus in front of it."
"Snap watched the bus and it gave him an idea."
"By the time he got to the new house he had a plan."
"Snap felt a bit happier when he jumped out of the van."
"He went to sniff every corner of his new home."
"The next day was Sunday and Ada and Harry had to unpack things."
"The new house had a garden at the back instead of a yard."
"The dogs round here stay in their own gardens,' Ada told Snap."
"I'll take you for a walk later.'"
"Something was trying to get through the fence."
"Snap couldn't believe it."
"That's not a real dog!"
"They wouldn't have a dog like that on Blossom Street.'"
"He didn't even bother to bark at the little dog."
"He heard its owner call, 'Foofoo, Foofoo pie!"
"Come to Mummy.'"
"On Monday morning Harry and Ada went to work."
"Of course he understands, don't you, Snap?'"
"Later, Foofoo's owner unlocked the door into the garden."
"He ran into the garden and started to dig a hole."
"Snap tried to talk to the dog on the other side."
"He was a large bulldog with droopy eyes."
"This looks better,' thought Snap."
"He barked in a friendly way."
"But the big dog said nothing at all."
"Opening doors was easy for a clever dog like Snap."
"He set off down the path and out of the front gate."
"He stopped at the bus stop and stood near a man and a woman."
"He sat up at the back and watched out of the window."
"The driver just saw his tail disappearing."
"Snap was already running down Blossom Street."
"He sniffed at all the doorsteps and the lampposts."
"He chased a cat back on to the yard wall."
"He put his head into Kelly's pram."
"Kelly laughed so much that her mum looked to see what was happening."
"Snap wagged his tail and looked hungry."
"You can eat that.'"
"When the children came home from school they yelled, 'Snap!"
"We thought you'd gone for ever.'"
"They patted him and hugged him."
"He played with them until they were called in for tea."
"She went to the door and called, 'Snap!"
"The children looked up and down Blossom Street."
"But they could not see him."
"In the end, Kelly's mum set off to Snap's new house."
"Ada and Harry were glad to see Kelly's mum."
"It's nice of you to visit us,' they said."
"Oh, he's here!'"
"He was fast asleep in the kitchen when we came home."
"I think he likes his new home.'"
"I came to tell you,' said Kelly's mum."
"How could he be?"
"It must be a dog that looks like him,' said Harry."
"Ask the children.'"
"Next day Ada watched Snap get on the big orange bus."
"She wanted to laugh."
"The bus driver said, 'It's you again, is it?'"
"When Ada and Harry got home Snap was curled up, fast asleep."
"Snap pricked up his ears and opened one eye."
"Just then there was a knock on the front door."
"More like a naughty dog, I think.'"
"Snap jumped up and wagged his tail."
"He liked having his photo taken."
