"What do you mean, you can't?"
"It's coiled around my arm!"
"Hold still,"" says Liam."
"He gently uncoils the snake until Mark is free."
"Then together they watch it slither off into the rainforest."
"Surely we could walk across here?"
"Look, it's not deep."
"Best not risk it,"" says Liam."
"Suddenly Mark feels something on his leg."

"The more you fight it, the deeper you'll go."
"Liam notices that Mark's hiking pole is floating next to Mark."

"Then pull your legs out slowly, one at a time."
"He inches his way towards Liam who hauls him out."
"Mark is amazed by how noisy it is."
"On the far side are some huts."

"Are we going to swim across?"
"Liam says, pointing at the river bank."
"Several large crocodiles are basking in the sun."
"OK, perhaps not,"" says Mark."
"But how are we going to get to the other side?"
"Liam consults the map."
"There's a ferry further along the bank,"" he says."
"Mark doesn't move."
"It's not far,"" says Liam."
"It isn't the distance that worries Mark."
"What about the crocodiles?"
"Didn't you read Dad's book?"
"Only some of it,"" Mark admits, sheepishly."
"OK. Keep your distance."
"No sudden movements and you'll be fine,"" Liam says."
"The ferry turns out to be a small bamboo raft tethered to the bank."
"Liam steps on board."
"Untie the rope and hop on!"
"A nearby crocodile opens its jaws and shuffles forward."
"Mark forgets all about not making sudden movements."
"He yanks the rope free and leaps onto the raft."
"The raft dips into the water."
"Liam yells as he fights to keep his balance."
"With a tremendous splash, Liam falls backwards into the river."
"One by one the crocodiles leave the bank and slip into the water."
"They're coming for Liam!"
"And it's all my fault!"
"Mark grabs the rope and whistle from his backpack."
"The crocodiles keep their distance."
"Mark is pleased he has done something right at last."
"He is also relieved to find it is cooler under the trees."
"Up ahead, a large black bear blocks their path."
"Put your arms out,"" says Liam."
"Make yourself look as big as you can and back away slowly."
"Mark moves backwards until he feels his back against a tree."
"Mark shins up the tree."
"But it is too late."
"THE BEAR HAS GOT YOU!"
"Start 2 Turn to page 46 to restart your mission at the rocky gorge."
"We're going to have to take care along here."
"The cliffs are unstable."
"They walk on, scanning the rocks for movement as they go."
"They are about halfway into the gorge when Liam stops and kneels down."
"I've got a stone in my boot,"" he says."
"I'll catch you up."
"As Mark goes ahead, he becomes aware of a rumbling sound."
"At first, he thinks it is thunder."
"Mark holds his backpack over his head and runs."
"The noise is deafening."
"He runs further along the gorge, dodging falling rocks and sharp stones."
"The bag disappears under a pile of rubble."
"The noise finally stops and the dust settles."
"The path between Mark and his brother is totally blocked."
"He shouts Liam's name."
"From the other side of the rock pile, Liam yells back."
"It's going to take me a while."
"I'll meet you at the village."
"Mark sets off alone."
"As he nears the village, he sees some farmers in the distance."
"They are wearing masks on the back of their heads."
"A farmer shows Mark where the tiger is likely to be."
"He sees how thin and hungry the tiger looks."
"One of the tiger's legs bears the marks of a recent bad fight."
"He just needs to ask the farmers for two things."
"The farmers agree to give the boys some raw meat and a mask each."
"But when it reaches the river bank, the tiger hesitates."
"It's not going to cross the river to the reserve!"
"I know what to do,"" says Mark."
"The tiger plunges into the water."
"They look tired but well."
"How did it go?"
"Or should I say, missions accomplished!"
"I'm proud of you."
"Did you have any trouble rescuing the animals?"
"No,"" laughs Mark."
"As it turned out, rescuing the animals was the easy bit!"
"I don't understand."
"What do you mean?"
"Mark and Liam exchange a look."
"They aren't quite sure what to say."
"Did you two get into trouble?"
"Richard asks, sternly."
"Nothing we couldn't handle."
"So what happened exactly?"
"Don't look directly at a baboon or show your teeth."
"Baboons see this as a sign of aggression."
"Keep quiet - don't scream or wave your arms around."

"Goldie's proper name is Goldeneye."
"She's Grandad's champion racing pigeon."
"She's won loads of cups."
"This morning she was released two hundred miles away with lots of other pigeons."
"And now she's racing back home."
"Come on, Goldie."
"Come on, Goldie!'"
"That's me, calling Goldeneye back home."
"But I can't see her yet."
"She should be flying in any minute."
"I really want Goldie to win this race."
"Go on, get going!'"
"I'm letting the other pigeons out to welcome Goldie home."
"They swoop round and round the loft."
"Then they settle on the roof."
"My eyes search the blue sky."
"Still no sign of Goldie."
"That's her!'"
"But it isn't."
"It's just a wild pigeon."
"Not Grandad's champion racer."
"That's what Grandad would have said: 'Calm down, Danny."
"Calm down, son!'"
"But it's hard to be calm."
"This job is very important."
"I'll tell you why."
"Before a race they put a rubber ring on every pigeon's leg."
"I've got to put that tube in Grandad's special timing clock."
"That records the time that Goldie finished the race."
"But I'll have to move like lightning."
"I can't waste a second."
"So that's why I'm nervous, waiting for Goldie."
"I'm getting more nervous every minute."
"Because Goldie should be here by now."
"But the sky is blue and empty."
"Maybe she isn't coming back."
"Thump, thump, thump."
"It's my heart pounding."
"That's how nervous I am."
"But where is she?"
"She's never been this late before."
"What am I going to tell Grandad?"
"Grandad says you can tell a lot by looking in a pigeon's eyes."
"You can tell if they're going to be a good racer."
"Goldie has got golden eyes."
"That's very rare."
"Grandad says he's never had a pigeon like her."
"She's one in a million, he says."
"But she isn't coming home."
"Wait, there's a flutter in the sky!"
"But it's only a crow."
"I'm giving up hope."
"But I wait until it's nearly dark."
"Then I lock the other pigeons in the loft and padlock the door."
"I've got to see Grandad tonight at the hospital."
"What am I going to tell him?"
"Grandad I haven't told Mum and Dad yet about Goldie being missing."
"They wouldn't understand."
"They're not interested in Grandad's pigeons."
"I tried to get out of coming to see Grandad."
"I told Mum, 'I can't go to the hospital."
"I don't feel very well!'"
"But she said, 'Come on, Danny."
"He'll be expecting you."
"He'll be really disappointed if you don't come to see him.'"
"So now we're walking into Grandad's ward."
"There are flowers everywhere but it doesn't smell of flowers."
"It smells of disinfectant."
"And everyone's talking in whispers, as if they're in a church."
"I've just walked right past him!"
"He's in a high white bed."
"He's got smart white and blue pyjamas on."
"But the words won't come out of my mouth."
"There's a machine by Grandad's bed."
"It looks a bit like a TV with green wavy lines on the screen."
"Grandad's joined to the machine by wires stuck to his chest."
"I know what's wrong with him."
"No one told me but I heard Mum and Dad talking about it."
"But it's a warning."
"He'll have to take it easy from now on.'"
"Mum puts some grapes on Grandad's bed."
"He looks a bit feeble."
"But he still sounds like the same old Grandad!"
"He's as grumpy as ever."
"He's like that with lots of people."
"But never with his pigeons."
"Did my champion racer win?'"
"I knew he'd ask me that question."
"My mind's all confused."
"Grandad sits up in bed."
"There are two red spots burning on his cheeks."
"There's nothing wrong with Goldie, is there?'"
"Of course there is."
"She might even be dead."
"But how can I tell him that?"
"Those peregrine falcons didn't get her, did they?'"
"Those ones that are nesting in the old quarry?"
"They're a menace, those hawks!"
"Someone should get rid of them!"
"Someone should pull down that nest."
"Then they'll go somewhere else!'"
"Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep!"
"Grandad's machine is going berserk."
"She looks angrily at me."
"You can see Grandad is upset!"
"Goldie is all right, isn't she?"
"Of course the falcons didn't get her!"
"Tell him Goldie is all right!'"
"I know I'm going to do it before I open my mouth."
"I'm going to tell Grandad a lie."
"Well, what else can I do?"
"If I tell him the truth he might get very poorly."
"He might even have another heart attack."
"And then it'll be all my fault."
"My stomach's all scrunched up."
"I feel really scared."
"Because, usually, Grandad can tell when I'm lying."
"And he says, 'You're lying to me, Danny."
"I can tell from your eyes.'"
"But this time he doesn't say it."
"He believes the lie."
"You've really made me feel better, Danny!"
"You've given me something to look forward to!'"
"The falcon's nest I'm still hoping Goldie might come back."
"I'm sitting outside Grandad's pigeon loft staring into the sky."
"I daren't even blink in case I miss her."
"Sometimes racing pigeons turn up days after a race."
"They get lost, or hit bad weather."
"But that's never happened to Goldie."
"She always comes home, right on time."
"I've known Goldie ever since she was an egg."
"I've known her since she was a floppy pink chick."
"I helped Grandad look after her."
"She's pale grey."
"I can't stop saying that."
"But it can't be a very good spell."
"It's not working."
"It's not bringing Goldie back home."
"What am I going to do?"
"I want my Grandad to get better."
"I want him to come out of hospital."
"You said she won the race!'"
"Then what am ^ I going to tell him?"
"I ask the other pigeons on the roof of the loft."
"But they're no help."
"They just fluff out their feathers and go, 'Cooooo!'"
"Suddenly, I've got a sick feeling in my stomach."
"I've remembered what Grandad said last night."
"About the peregrine falcons in the old quarry."
"It makes me shudder."
"Especially when it's tired at the end of the race."
"And when they eat one, there's nothing left but the feet."
"I can see the old quarry from Grandad's garden."
"It's only across that field."
"That's where those evil falcons have got their nest."
"Then they'll go away.'"
"I hate those falcons."
"They probably killed Goldie."
"I bet they did!"
"I can feel myself getting really angry."
"I didn't know what to do before."
"I was all mixed up."
"But now I know exactly what to do."
"Now I know exactly what I can say to Grandad when he comes home."
"I did it, all on my own."
"They're never going to kill your racing pigeons again!'"
"In the quarry It only takes five minutes to run to the old quarry."
"I go skidding down through the trees to the quarry floor."
"I keep getting these awful pictures in my head."
"Of Goldie snatched out of the sky by cruel claws."
"Just as she's almost reached her home."
"I can't bear to think about it."
"Ever since she was a tiny, helpless chick!"
"I want to get those falcons."
"I want revenge, for Goldie."
"I want to be able to tell Grandad, Take it easy, Grandad."
"You don't have to worry any more."
"I've taken care of those falcons for you!'"
"But I can't see any falcons."
"Where's their nest?"
"I look around the quarry walls."
"That must be it."
"It's on the steepest side of the quarry."
"It looks like a big pile of sticks on a ledge."
"It's a long way up ..."
"But then I think of Goldie, eaten, except for her feet."
"I don't want to think any more."
"So I start climbing the quarry wall."
"Even though I can hardly see where I'm going."
"My eyes are all blurry with tears."
"I'll get you, falcons!'"
"I shout up to the nest."
"My voice doesn't sound like my voice."
"It sounds like a growling, angry bear."
"It's not hard at all."
"I'm climbing fast - there are old tree roots to grab hold of."
"My hands are bleeding."
"But I don't feel the pain."
"Some rocks go clattering down."
"My foot's slipped."
"I'm hanging on with my finger tips."
"I'm going to fall...!"
"Phew, found a foothold."
"Don't look down."
"I'm clinging like a starfish to the rock face."
"Only a little way to go."
"My arms are so weak and trembly."
"But I'm there."
"To send it tumbling to the quarry floor."
"Then I see the chick."
"I never thought there'd be a chick!"
"Its parents aren't here to protect it."
"It's pink and helpless, flopping about in the nest."
"I think of Goldie, when she was small and helpless."
"When I looked after her."
"I pull my hand back."
"I can't do it."
"All my angry feelings gush away, like water down a plughole."
"I can't hurt that baby chick."
"Not even for Goldie."
"Not even for Grandad."
"I start climbing again."
"Leaving the nest behind."
"I'm going up to the top of the quarry."
"There's not far to go."
"I'm almost there... 'Oh nor That's me, crying out."
"I just looked down."
"I can't move!"
"It's a soft, feathery bundle."
"I know straight away it's her."
"No other pigeon has got golden eyes like that."
"She's one in a million."
"You'll be all right now.'"
"I forget about being scared."
"For ages, I just lie in the grass, with my eyes closed."
"When the world stops spinning I open them."
"The first thing I see is the falcons."
"They've come back."
"I just have to say, 'Wow!'"
"I can't seem to take my eyes off them."
"I never knew they were so beautiful."
"Then I sit up and peek inside my shirt at Goldie."
"She looks very sick."
"She's a scrap of shivering feathers."
"And her golden eyes are dull."
"There's no sparkle in them."
"Why didn't you fly home?'"
"Then I see what's wrong."
"It's her leg."
"It's tucked up underneath her."
"It looks like it's broken."
"I stand up then and start running."
"My legs are still shaky from the climb."
"Touch and go It was touch and go with Goldie."
"I didn't think she would live."
"I've seen Grandad set pigeons' legs before."
"He does it with a cardboard tube and some sticky tape."
"But it's not as easy as it looks."
"When I tried it with Goldie my hands were shaking."
"I was so scared of hurting her."
"But I did it."
"I took off her racing ring and taped up her broken leg."
"Then I put her in a shoebox in the pigeon loft."
"She just sat there, looking miserable."
"I put some grains of corn in."
"She didn't eat them."
"I gave her some water."
"She didn't drink it."
"I thought, 'She'll be dead by morning.'"
"I couldn't sleep."
"I tossed and turned all night."
"She had a drink; she ate some corn."
"Her golden eyes grew bright again."
"Well, I was really pleased."
"But I was really worried too."
"Because I haven't taken the splint off Goldie's leg yet."
"I don't know if it's mended properly."
"I don't know if she'll ever race again."
"So here I am, sitting outside Grandad's pigeon loft, worried sick."
"He'll be coming home in about an hour's time."
"I know that voice."
"It's Grandad, coming down the garden."
"He's much sooner than I expected!"
"I've got Goldie in my hands."
"I can feel her heart going pit-a-pit-a-pat."
"I've taken the splint off, just this minute."
"But I haven't let her fly yet."
"I daren't do it."
"But I have to."
"I have to find out if she can fly before Grandad gets here."
"There's my champion racer!'"
"He's got a stick to walk with."
"He sits down beside me on the bench, slowly, very slowly."
"He strokes Goldie's feathers, gently, with his finger."
"The other pigeons whizz over our heads."
"Seeing my champion racer fly.'"
"My stomach's doing back flips."
"But it's no good putting it off any longer."
"I stand up and hold Goldie high in the air."
"I whisper to her."
"Then I toss her up into the sky."
"She flies straight and quick as an arrow to join the other birds."
"Sunshine's glittering on her wings."
"I've still got some explaining to do."
"I'll have to tell Grandad the truth about Goldie."
"That she broke her leg."
"That she didn't win the race."
"But somehow I don't think he'll mind too much."
"Grandad can't see them because his eyes aren't so good."
"But I recognize them straight away."
"They're brilliant fliers."
"They'd better not catch my Goldie!"
"That'd make me really sad."
"But I don't want to hurt them."
"And if that sounds mixed-up I can't help it."
"That's the way I feel."
"There's nothing wrong with his ears!"
"The children were doing a project on the Olympic Games."

"The magic took the girls back in time, to a village in Greece."
"A boy was calling to the villagers."
"Follow me to the games,"" he said."
"Can we go too?"
"As long as they are male."
"The men and the boys from the village went to the games."
"It's not fair!"
"Let's follow them,"" said Biff."
"Outside the games, there were lots of guards."
"They only let men and boys in to the games."
"We'll never get in,"" said Biff."
"I wish we could see!"
"Let's climb a tree,"" she said."
"The girls climbed an olive tree."
"They could see the games."
"They watched a race."
"Lots of men ran with shields."
"The winner won a prize."
"The prize was a vase."
"A man put a crown on the winner's head."
"Then the girls watched some men throwing discs as far as they could."
"The girl was under the tree."
"If anyone catches you here, you'll be in for the high jump!"
"Then, why are you here?"
"I'm picking olives,"" said the girl."
"My name is Hera."
"You'd better come with me to the village."
"In the village, they met Hera's friend, Mila."
"It's always quiet when the games are on,"" said Mila."
"It's so boring!"
"Suddenly, Anneena had an idea."
"Can you get all of your friends together?"
"The girls in the village came to the meeting."
"This is my grandmother,"" said Mila."
"She paints the vases for the games."
"Listen everyone,"" said Anneena."
"Why should boys have all the fun?"
"Let's have a girls' Olympic Games!"
"There were all sorts of races and all the girls took part."
"There was a three-legged race and a sack race."
"Mila's grandmother gave the girls some old plates."
"The girls threw them like discs."
"They threw them as far as they could."
"The girls had an olive-and-spoon race."
"Biff dropped her olives and Hera slipped on them!"
"Mila's grandmother painted the girls on a vase."
"Hera made some crowns from olive twigs."

"The boys and the men came back."
"That will never catch on!"

"There was a display about the Greek Olympics."

"I wish we were back home with Mum.'"
"They'll come and find us in the morning."
"They've got to."
"We've just got to wait.'"
