"There are two main types of hormones."
"One is seroid hormones."
"THey are nonpolar and need no receptor Counter regulatory hormones."

"Other hormones also make the glucose level go up or down."
"They tell the cells to put glucose back into the blood."
"Counter-regulatory hormones for insulin are glucagon and epinephrine."
"However a few things are controlled in different ways."
"One rare way is ""positive feedback""."
"In negative feedback, the hormone's effect makes a gland stop making hormones."
"In positive feedback the opposite happens."
"The hormone that causes this is ""oxytocin""."
"This hormone is made by the pituitary gland."
"Nerves in the cervix send a message to the pituitary."
"This message makes the pituitary release more oxytocin."

"This is the ""dormant phase""."
"This is to kill the ""Plasmodium"" in the liver."

"Different places have ""P. falciparum"" that is resistant to different medicines."
"The most important resistance is chloroquine-resistance."
"In some places it is chloroquine-resistant."
"This means chloroquine does not kill it."
"In these places quinine can be used."
"Intravenous means given into a vein."
"The IV medicine used for very bad chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria is quinine."
"But sometimes doctors still use IV quinine."

"It killed a lot of wildlife too."
"They learned that DDT stays in the environment for a long time."
"DDT used in Africa may go to Europe."
"This is why DDT is not allowed to be used in farming anymore."
"For these reasons, people mostly use other chemicals for vector control."
"These cost more money than DDT."
"And there are ways to control malaria that don't use chemicals at all."
"Vector control is not the only way to stop malaria."
"And DDT is not the only chemical that can be used for vector control."
"The best way to stop malaria is to use a combination of methods."
"This is why DDT is still allowed to be used for controlling malaria."

"Chipping, shovelling, scraping, clearing."

"The rubble felt sharp and hot beneath his hands."
"His palms were thick with dust."
"He crouched, sweeping aside the dirt."
"And then more dirt."
"And then something hard."
"The waterboy swept faster, ignoring the sharpness of the stones."
"It was something wide, and flat, and made of stone."
"He looked up, shielding his eyes from the fierce glare of the sun."
"Carter jumped to his feet and hurried over."
"Voices started up all around."
"Probably found a fragment of a pot,"" they mumbled to themselves."

"This could mean bonus payments for all of them!"
"Soon a second step had been cleared."
"Carter could hardly contain his excitement."
"No, don't get your hopes up yet,"" he told himself."
"It might be nothing."
"It might be nothing of importance."
"Or it might be the one tomb he'd spent years looking for."
"One step after another."
"Down, and down."
"Until there were sixteen."
"Across its rough surface were... markings...?"
"Carter took a closer look."
"They were the imprints of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics."
"But they were clearly there."
"This was an ancient hiding place of some sort, that much was certain."
"The waterboy flicked his hair from his eyes with a grimy hand."
"Their thoughts were on their bonuses."
"This was going to be a good day for them, too."
"Carter took off his hat and fanned his face for a moment or two."
"Flies buzzed around his head and he swatted them away."
"Now was a time for clear, careful thought."
"Carter dashed back up the steps."
"This had better be worth it, Carter, m'boy,"" he grumbled."
"Come along, girl!"
"Lady Evelyn mumbled something that nobody else heard."
"I simply can't stay out in these conditions a moment more than necessary!"
"Carter was hurrying over to the excavation."
"The waterboy grumbled under his breath."
"Carnarvon followed Carter down the staircase."
"Carter was already impatient to proceed."
"He beckoned to the old man hurriedly."
"Carnarvon made his way down the rock-strewn steps as fast as he could."
"You see the shape of the cartouches, the ovals which contain the hieroglyphs?"
"At first, I thought that it could be the tomb of a noble."
"Or perhaps a store for the royal family."
"But then..."" ""Then what?"
"He paused for a moment, suddenly realising what Carter meant."
"So you've found a name?"
"Lady Evelyn appeared at the top of the steps."
"For the first time, she saw the wall-seal marked with ancient writing."
"Did we bring a hamper with us?"
"Carter paid no attention to what she was saying."
"He looked at Carnarvon steadily."
"We have a name,"" he said."
"He dusted down the lower part of the plaster."
"The impressions are better preserved down here."
"Nine slaves, beneath the picture of a jackal."
"And here, three sets of symbols spelling out the name of the pharaoh."
"Lord Carnarvon squatted down and peered at the hieroglyphs with screwed-up eyes."
"Can't get close enough, m'boy."
"Not with m'back playing up."
"You'll have to translate for me."
"Carter pointed to the three sets of symbols, one after the other."
"Tut... Ankh... Amun..."" Carnarvon sat back on the steps."
"He put out a hand to steady himself."
"Good Lord,"" he whispered."
"This is the tomb you've been searching for all these years."
"Carter pointed to the top left corner of the plaster."
"It's not all good news."
"Up there, can you see?"
"There was a triangular section in the corner which looked different from the rest."
"In ancient times, I believe."
"There may be something left inside, though."
"The robbers wouldn't have bothered to re-seal a completely empty tomb."
"Then let's not delay,"" said Carnarvon."
"Stop getting in the way up there, girl!"
"Let the diggers through!"
"The plaster seal was demolished."
"Someone had been there before them."
"He turned to his men."
"Let's get it clear!"
"For hours they toiled."
"The sun slowly moved across the sky."
"The burnt orange glow of late afternoon bathed the steps leading to the tomb."
"Up the steps came workers laden with full buckets."
"Down the steps went workers with empty buckets."
"A steady, unending parade, up and down, down and up."
"Exactly like the first, a thick plaster block across the corridor."
"Carter rushed to examine it."
"Carter's fingers delicately traced the outlines of the hieroglyphs."
"The light from the candle shuddered."
"He realised his hand was shaking."
"What d'you think's behind this wall?"
"His voice echoed in the stone corridor."
"All in all, it's still an important archaeological find."
"For minutes there was only the sound of metal scratching at the seal."
"Nobody said a word."
"Lady Evelyn hardly dared to breathe."
"Partly, it was fear of the unknown."
"Whether this tomb had been robbed or not, it was still a tomb."
"His voice sounded loud and dense in the stuffy atmosphere of the corridor."
"Carter held the candle to the hole, to test for poisonous gases."
"I think it's safe,"" he whispered at last."
"Look inside, m'boy,"" said Carnarvon."
"Can you see if the room is very large?"
"Carter moved up close to the hole he had made in the wall."
"Hot air was still flowing from inside."
"It brushed against his face."
"The hole was a ragged, black shape."
"And beyond it...?"
"Carter took the candle."
"Grit and plaster fragments edged inside his sleeve as his arm slid forward."
"At first, he could see nothing."
"The glow from the candle was faint and shifting."
"But as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom, shapes began to emerge."
"And all reflecting the candlelight with the glowing shine of gold."
"Carter could hardly speak."
"Wonderful things,"" he whispered at last."
"But it had been a very long day."
"Everyone went home for the night."
"He'd designed it himself, and called it Castle Carter."
"None of them anticipated getting any sleep."
"It had eaten Carter's pet bird."
"Filthy beast,"" grumbled Carnarvon."
"It's just doing what it does to survive,"" mumbled Carter."
"The moment when we broke into the tomb,"" said Lady Evelyn."
"Father, I'm getting frightened."
"They say these ancient tombs are cursed."
"Steady on, girl,"" said Carnarvon, feeling rather unsteady."
"Superstitious nonsense,"" said Carter."
"The local people don't believe in all that curse business."
"It's us Europeans who like to make up silly stories."
"We have to deal in facts."
"And the facts are that this could be the find of the century."
"I agree,"" said Carnarvon."
"We have to handle the situation very carefully."
"Something like this can't be kept quiet,"" nodded Carter."
"There's never been a find like it before."
"It could make headline news across the world."
"Before we know it, the valley will be swarming with people."
"So we must work out exactly what we've got down there."
"As soon as possible."
"Get them to send out their top chaps."
"Carter paused for a moment."
"I was thinking... rather sooner than that."
"I was thinking we should take a closer look tonight."
"You must be mad!"
"We have electric torches,"" said Carter."
"We have our knowledge of the ancient Egyptians to guide us."
"What we don't have is time."
"The heat of the day had vanished completely, replaced by a dry chill."
"He would have kicked himself if he'd known what he was missing."
"Each carried a brightly shining flashlight which threw a wide beam across the walls."
"The sound of their footsteps seemed unbearably loud."
"Carter dug at the wall."
"The room was about eight metres wide, four metres deep."
"Its walls were plain stone."
"It was as if the tomb had been sealed only yesterday."
"I feel like we shouldn't be here,"" whispered Lady Evelyn."
"They aimed their torches this way and that."
"The horns of a sacred ox sculpture shone out of the darkness."
"To the left were the broken remains of chariots."
"Broken by the ancient tomb robbers."
"The annexe was a chaotic mess of smashed odds and ends."
"Then they stole everything in this annexe and left, re-sealing the entrance."
"They must have intended to come back, but something stopped them."
"Perhaps they were killed for the treasures they'd already taken."
"Perhaps the location of this tomb was lost for some reason."
"Either way, it's to our great good fortune."
"Suddenly Lady Evelyn gasped."
"She almost dropped her torch in fright."
"Guardians,"" whispered Carter."
"Between the guardians was a richly decorated casket."
"Carter and Carnarvon lifted it to one side and stood before the third seal."
"In the sharp torchlight, their faces were a maze of light and dark."
"Their breathing echoed off the ceiling."
"Carter began to dig at the base of the seal this time."
"He placed his torch to one side."
"The carved faces of animals watched from the darkness."
"Well,"" said Carter at last."
"Let's see what's inside, shall we?"
"The hole was small."
"Carter shone his flashlight through to the other side."
"Reflected back were ancient Egyptian designs, shaped in gold against a vibrant blue."
"Is it made of gold?"
"No, wood I think,"" said Carter."
"With gold laid over the top."
"It might be a box, or the side of a large ornament."
"Perhaps we should make a second hole to one side?"
"To get around it?"
"He coughed as stirred-up dust clung around his face."
"I don't think we'll need to,"" he said."
"There's just enough space to crawl through and stand up in."
"He struggled to twist himself around."
"Whatever this is here, it's quite big."
"I can't feel a corner yet."
"You two go through,"" said Carnarvon."
"I'm feeling as ancient as these artefacts meself!"
"Don't think I'd quite make the squeeze."
"Carter was already hauling himself through into the blackness beyond."
"He'd left his torch in the outer chamber."
"The gap between the wall-seal and the whatever-it-was was barely half a metre."
"He groped cautiously to the left."
"Then he felt something on the floor..."
"Loose, round... A jar, perhaps."
"He looked over his shoulder."
"Careful, girl,"" called Carnarvon."
"Priceless relics in there, don't forget!"
"Still treats me like a baby,"" mumbled Lady Evelyn to herself."
"She stretched out her arms."
"Neither can I,"" whispered Carter."
"It must be a good five metres wide."
"From the outer chamber, Carnarvon pushed two torches through the hole."
"A pair of eyes!"
"Carter's torch shone on the side of the huge object."
"Lady Evelyn had never felt so frightened in her life."
"She pressed her back to the wall, and held up her torch."
"It lit up the whole room."
"Ancient life and ancient times loomed over them from the walls."
"In another, he met Osiris, god of the dead."
"In another, the dog-headed Anubis, the embalmer."
"The huge object in front of them was that same wooden shrine."
"It took up almost the entire chamber."
"But it was the shrine that commanded their attention."
"I need more light!"
"Lady Evelyn squeezed around the corner of the shrine and crouched down beside Carter."
"The final room,"" breathed Carter."
"That's the god Anubis, watching over the dead king."
"He turned back to the small doors in the shrine."
"Is there anything there?"
"The shrine is unbroken,"" said Carter."
"It hasn't been opened for over three thousand years."
"So... what's inside this shrine?"
"Tutankhamun himself,"" whispered Carter."
"And inside that... the mummy of the king."
"Undisturbed for thousands of years."
"Lying here, in the silence, in the darkness."

"That's the job for me,' said Doohickey."
"A loud alarm sounded inside the house, followed by a terrific explosion."
"A window flew open at the top of the house."
"A cloud of thick smoke billowed out."
"The professor's face peered down at Doohickey."
"I've come about the job.'"
"A moment later, the front door sprang half-open."
"A huge mountain of post had stopped the door from opening properly."
"But there was no one there."
"A buzzer sounded in Doohickey's ear."
"He was surprised to see a little air-ship bobbing in the hallway beside him."
"Tiny propellers spun the ship around."
"Chapter Two He followed the ship up a tall, winding staircase."
"He passed room after room stuffed full of strange-looking machines."
"Were they the professor's inventions?"
"He popped into one of the rooms to take a closer look."
"The cage seemed to be stuffed full of straw."
"Doohickey pushed his hand into it."
"A tiny needle was sticking out of his thumb."
"There was a label fixed to the computer screen."
"The next machine had lots of electric fans fixed beneath a large metal funnel."
"There was sand all over the floor."
"He switched it on."
"Sand began trickling out of the funnel and the fans started spinning."
"Then the strangest thing happened."
"The sand didn't fall on to the floor."
"It hung in the air."
"And slowly, it shaped itself into a floating castle."
"Doohickey walked slowly around the machine."
"He couldn't believe what he was seeing."
"Then all of a sudden, he bumped into someone else."
"When he saw who it was, he nearly jumped out of his skin."
"The other person was him!"
"It was like looking in a mirror, except that there was no glass."
"Doohickey reached out his hand and the other Doohickey did the same."
"It was too creepy!"
"He stepped backwards straight into the floating sand-castle."
"The castle exploded and Doohickey found himself in the middle of a sandstorm."
"Sand blew everywhere, into his eyes and up his nose."
"And so had the other Doohickey!"
"Then Doohickey noticed a large metal plate on the floor."
"There was another label on it."
"The metal plate was another of the professor's inventions."
"It had made the other Doohickey appear when he had stepped on to it."
"I won't try that again, he thought."
"It's a bit too spooky."
"Doohickey saw the air-ship bobbing up and down in the doorway."
"It had come back to find him."
"He couldn't think of a better excuse."
"The ship buzzed again crossly and glided back towards the stairs."
"Chapter Three They reached the top of the house."
"The air-ship led Doohickey into a smoky attic."
"It was stuffed full of books, test tubes and lumps of tangled wiring."
"A small shaggy dog peered out at him from beneath a workbench."
"A cat lay sunning itself on the window sill."
"He was hunched over a heap of metal in one corner."
"It didn't look very exciting."
"He expected that it was a machine for getting blood from a stone."
"Or for making omelettes without breaking eggs."
"The professor scribbled some words on to a scrap of paper."
"He fed the paper through the slot in the robot's chest."
"Then he pressed a big button and stepped back."
"The robot hummed and whirred for a bit."
"Then it climbed slowly to its feet."
"Its head almost scraped the attic ceiling."
"The lights on the robot's face flickered on and off."
"It looked as if it was thinking about something."
"And then ... it painted a picture of the professor's dog."
"It played a piece of music on the test tubes."
"And it discovered three new ways of splitting the atom."
"He was really amazed."
"Besides, I've got better things for you to do.'"
"He handed Doohickey the list of jobs."
"If you can't find anything, ask Newton.'"
"Doohickey didn't know what to say to this."
"So he looked at the list of jobs the professor had given him."
"These jobs are all boring,' said Doohickey."
"He tore up the list and threw it into a bin."
"Look at all these silly machines, he thought."
"Then he had a brain-wave."
"He set off upstairs again."
"He stuck it back together with some sticky tape."
"Newton studied the list."
"The professor isn't going to find out!'"
"He hit the big button."
"The robot hummed, whirred and then straightened itself up."
"The robot stomped down the stairs and into the professor's bathroom."
"It grabbed a great armful of dirty clothes."
"Then it carried them down to the kitchen."
"Next, it took some meat and vegetables out of the fridge."
"It chopped and sliced them to make a delicious stew."
"Then it emptied the whole lot into the washing machine!"
"And it took the Hoover outside and sucked the leaves off the lawn."
"But they had never seen anything quite like the robot."
"The robot had just fetched a hammer and nails."
"It was now nailing up the front door."
"The robot didn't seem to mind that everyone was looking at it."
"It propped a ladder up against the side of the house."
"The huge machine lumbered towards him."
"Doohickey was still fast asleep on the professor's bed."
"I told you it would all end in tears.'"
"Chapter Six They ran downstairs to the hall."
"The carpet was covered in shredded paper."
"Newton held up a scrap of paper with a postage stamp stuck to it."
"The robot seems to have got the jobs mixed up,' said Newton."
"You said it was OK!'"
"The dog looked uncomfortable."
"But the robot barged straight past him, into the kitchen."
"The robot ripped the fridge away from the wall and carried it upstairs."
"The robot carried the fridge all the way up to the attic."
"It stopped in front of Newton's freshly painted picture."
"The robot took some more food and stuffed it into the hole."
"He rushed around the back of the house and in the back door."
"The attic was a nightmare."
"The robot was lurching around the room with a length of electric cable."
"It was trying to catch the cat."
"Luckily, the terrified cat was staying one leap ahead of it."
"Newton was sitting on a tall cupboard, enjoying the show."
"A scrap of paper rolled out of the slot in its chest."
"The professor snatched up the paper and looked at it."
"I was ... just err ...' panted Doohickey."
"The professor gave Doohickey a hard stare."
"I just, um ... thought that ...' Doohickey tried to explain."
"The professor gave Doohickey an even harder stare."
"Doohickey gazed around the attic."
"It had been untidy to start with."
"But that was nothing to how it looked now."
"The professor was giving him another hard stare."
"It would take hours to tidy up on his own."

"Chapter 5 - Next stop, Patagonia!"

"So why didn't they work for Dani's agents?"

"The watches use our energy to shrink."
"I wouldn't be so sure,"" said Cat."
"She always did worry about us."
"How would you three like a trip to Patagonia?"

"But how will we get there?"
"Max strode over to Dani's new X-crafts."

"I'm getting a strange reading."
"Ant peered at the computer screen."
"It looks like another craft was here not long ago."
"And it used a massive amount of power before flying away again."
"Do you know where it went?"
"No, but we can easily follow it."
"It left a huge energy trail."
"Ant gave Tiger the coordinates for a new course."
"The air in Hawkwing began to chill."
"Before long, Max spotted another craft in the distance."
"Then he looked down at his watch."
"The X-bot alert had started to flash a warning."
"But I thought we got rid of them."
"And that thing doesn't look like any X-bot we've seen before."
"Is it some sort of super X-bot?"
"Max stared through Hawkwing's view port at the machine in front of them."
"Cat, can you magnify that thing it's holding?"
"Cat activated her watch."
"Zooming in on it now."
"Hey, it's the whales!"
"Ant yelled, as the picture appeared on Cat's watch."
"And they're inside some sort of globe."
"They've been shrunk to micro-size."
"How and why have they been put into that silly globe?"
"I'd like to know that myself,"" Max replied."
"But first things first."
"We have to save the whales."
"Hang on to your seats!"
"Chapter 7 - Save the whales!"
"Max fired up the afterburners and Hawkwing shot forward, chasing the strange X-bot."
"They got closer and closer, until at last they were just behind it."
"Luckily, the X-bot did not appear to have detected them."
"Shall we try and grab the globe using Hawkwing's claws?"
"No, it's too dangerous,"" Max replied."
"We might break the glass and hurt the whales."
"We need to use our watches to make the globe grow."
"Can we open the front hatch?"
"Tiger pulled a lever."
"Max put Hawkwing into autopilot and activated the tracking device."
"He programmed Hawkwing to follow the X-bot."
"Then he turned to the others."
"Right everyone,"" he shouted, ""point your watches at the globe."
"Now turn the dials clockwise twice and press the X."
"Cat, Ant and Tiger did as Max said."
"A purple beam blasted out of each watch towards the globe."
"Immediately, it began to grow."
"The whales are growing too!"
"The globe grew bigger and bigger and so did the whales inside it."
"They're falling towards the sea,"" shouted Cat."
"What shall we do?"
"Try and lower them gently,"" said Tiger."
"The children's arms strained forwards."
"They felt themselves being pulled towards the open hatch."
"Hawkwing soared along beside it."
"The globe grew to the size of a car."
"Dropping the globe, the X-bot plummeted towards the water."
"The children were tugged forwards as they took the full weight of the globe."
"They struggled to control their beam as the sea loomed closer below them."
"We're directly above the sea at Station W,"" said Cat."
"Finally, the globe plunged into the sea."
"Are the whales OK?"
"Yes, they're fine,"" Ant replied."
"The globe protected them in the fall."
"How are we going to get them out of that globe?"
"I don't know,"" said Max."
"But there's one person who will know what to do."
"Tiger knew who Max meant."
"Dani stood waiting for them."
"Her arms were folded, her lips pursed."
"Cat, Tiger and Ant stayed behind him."
"What on earth have you kids been up to?"
"You've rescued the whales?"
"But that's what I sent my new agents to do."

"Now we need to find out who this man is."
"I need to know why he and his X-bot want to kidnap endangered animals."
"Just then a woman in a NICE uniform appeared."
"Delivery for you, Dani,"" she said, handing Dani a package."
"Dani opened the parcel and gasped."
"Inside it was a beautiful snow globe."
"It's like the globe the X-bot was carrying!"

"You've got a plan?"
"He glanced at the massive X-bot getting nearer and nearer."
"Tiger ignored the question."
"He had just spotted a broken drainpipe."
"Then he threw it over Ant."
"That's not my idea of a plan!"
"Yeah,"" said Cat."
"What are you doing, Tiger?"
"Tiger began to stare at Ant's watch."
"Remember what happens when your watch gets wet?"
"Tiger said to Ant."
"You want to grow Robo-Rex?"
"Just at that moment there was a fizzing noise from Ants watch."
"Max quickly put Robo-Rex on the ground."
"A bolt of green light flashed out from Ants watch and hit Robo-Rex."
"Robo-Rex began to grow ... and grow ... and grow."
"He had forgotten all about being wet."
"The X-bot had stopped smashing its way towards the children."
"Now it was glaring at the giant Robo-Rex."
"Tiger pulled the remote control out of his pocket."
"Tiger pushed a button."
"Robo-Rex opened its huge mouth and let out a deafening and fearsome roar."
"The X-bot hissed back."
"Time to deal with that X-bot,"" said Tiger."
"The children followed Robo-Rex out of the alley."
"The X-bot took a step back when it saw Robo-Rex coming."
"It let out a horrible metallic growl and gnashed its metal jaws."

"I'm trying my best,"" he replied."
"Think you can do any better?"
"Cat held up her hands as Tiger shoved the remote towards her."
"No, no,"" she said."
"I'm not doing it."
"Just then, the X-bot saw its chance."
"Tiger jabbed the buttons on the remote control, but nothing happened."
"Robo-Rex just lay there in a cloud of dust, refusing to budge."
"Then they saw that the red light had gone out in Robo-Rex s eyes."
"The batteries must have gone flat!"
"I told you you'd wear them ouuuuut,"" said Cat."
"The boys watched helplessly as the X-bot carried Cat off down the street."

"I can fix it,"" he said."

"But it will need time to dry."
"Cat, Ant and Nok joined them at the rear of the ship."
"I'll go with Cat and Nok to look for the fragment."
"No problem,"" said Ant."
"Nok was staring hard into the distance."
"I think we need to go that way,"" he said."
"I can feel the energy from the fragment,"" Nok replied."
"It's pulling me towards it."
"Let's get going then,"" said Max."
"Max, Cat and Nok pressed their buttons."
"They all grew to normal size."
"The three of them set off."
"Cat flipped up the magni-scope on her watch."
"There is a cave up ahead,"" she said."
"Maybe the fragment will be in there."
"The cave was further away than they expected."
"Max felt like he had been walking forever."
"Nok said, walking past him."
"He was desperate to find the next fragment."
"Just then, a glistening cloud of dust blew around them."
"It's a mineral storm!"
"Quick, we need to get to the cave!"
"The shimmering dust began to swirl faster."
"They started to cough and splutter."
"It looked as if the walls were covered in tiny stars."
"Wow,"" said Cat, gazing round."
"Where's the fragment?"
"Nok spotted a picture etched into the wall."
"As he touched it, blue power surged from his hand lighting it up."
"It's a map,"" said Cat."
"Look, there's an X,"" Max said."
"He pointed to an etching of a pyramid."
"That must be where the fragment is hidden."

"The Boscombe Valley Mystery chapter 1 An Ordinary Crime?"
"I try to keep a record of the cases he has solved."
"One such case was the Boscombe Valley Mystery."
"Holmes was pacing up and down the platform."
"I need someone I can rely on.'"
"Now and then he stopped to make notes and to think."
"I've not seen a paper for days.'"
"It is the unusual which makes things easy!'"
"A serious case has already been made against the son of the murdered man."
"It happened in Boscombe Valley, near Hereford."
"The owner of much land in that area is a Mr John Turner."
"He came back from Australia a few years ago and settled here.'"
"One he let out to another Australian, Mr Charles McCarthy."
"McCarthy has a son of eighteen, called James.'"
"He told his servant that he had an appointment at three o'clock."
"He never came back alive."
"Both say he was walking alone."
"He thought the son was following his father.'"
"There was another witness."
"She says that she saw James and his father having a violent quarrel."
"Holmes continued, 'She ran away and told her mother."
"They followed him and found the body by the side of the pool."
"It looks exceedingly grave against the young man.'"
"And it makes an interesting case."
"According to James McCarthy, he had been away in Bristol for three days."
"He came back to find his father out."
"About a hundred yards from the pool he heard a cry of ""Cooee!"
"For some reason, an argument took place and James walked off."
"He had not gone far when he heard a dreadful cry."
"He held him in his arms but he could do nothing."
"He then ran off to the lodge-keeper's for help.'"
"He said he spoke about a rat.'"
"And the other matter was the subject of the quarrel.'"
"Holmes looked up at me, raised his eyebrows and smiled."
"This is not such a simple case as they would have us believe.'"
"I know that James didn't do it."
"We have known each other since we were children."
"He is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly.'"
"He was such a strong man once - when he was in Australia."
"Mr McCarthy was the only man who knew him in those days.'"
"Thank you, Miss Turner, you have been a great help.'"
"She smiled gratefully at him."
"Father misses me so, if I leave him.'"
"She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered."
"This gave me pause for thought."
"Then there was the matter of the man's dying words."
"Holmes returned late without much more information."
"He is hardly more than a boy!'"
"However, good may come of this evil."
"It seems that the barmaid found out he was in serious trouble."
"She has thrown him over."
"First, the murdered man had an appointment with someone."
"That person could not have been his son."
"His son was away and he didn't know when he was returning.'"
"And the second thing?'"
"The murdered man was heard to cry ""Cooee!"
"The case depends upon such things!'"
"Holmes closed his eyes and would say no more."
"As the carriage bounced down the country lanes, Holmes turned to me."
"Mr McCarthy lived at Hatherley Farm rent free.'"
"It did seem odd but I could deduce nothing from it."
"We soon arrived at the farm, a comfortable-looking two-storey building."
"She also found a pair of his son's boots."
"Holmes measured them all very carefully and then set off to the pool."
"Many of the important tracks have been obscured.'"
"He peered at the ground, then cried, 'Aha!"
"Here arc three separate tracks of the same feet.'"
"Twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly."
"The soles are deeply marked but the heels hardly visible."
"That bears out his story."
"Here are the father's feet as he paced up and down."
"What have we here?"
"Now, where did they come from?'"
"Holmes paced up and down, sometimes losing and sometimes finding the track."
"He stayed there a long time, turning over leaves and dry twigs."
"He showed me the stone."
"There are no marks on it.'"
"It matches the injuries and there is no sign of another weapon.'"
"He limps with the right leg and wears thick-soled shooting boots."
"He smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar holder and carries a blunt penknife."
"After lunch, Holmes sat with his tapering fingers together, staring into space."
"Then he turned to me."
"I should value your advice."
"Let me explain.'"
"The other was McCarthy's dying words about a rat.'"
"As far as McCarthy knew, his son was in Bristol."
"The Cooee was meant to call the person he was meeting."
"But Cooee is an Australian greeting."
"Hence he was expecting to meet someone from Australia.'"
"Holmes took out a folded paper from his pocket."
"I had it sent over this morning.'"
"He put his hand over part of the map."
"He raised his hand."
"I could see the whole word."
"That was the word that McCarthy spoke."

"So-and-so of Ballarat.'"
"Now, you see, I have narrowed down the field."
"A tall Australian who is at home in the district."
"At home enough to find his way through the back of the estate.'"
"But what about his lameness?'"
"He put less weight on it."
"Because he limped.'"
"A blow struck from behind yet from the left side."
"Surely a left-handed man?"
"He stood behind the tree during the argument between James and his father."
"He even smoked there - I found the ash of a cigar."
"As you know, I am an expert on tobacco ash."
"The tip had been cut off, not bitten."
"It was not a clean cut - so I deduced a blunt penknife.'"
"The murderer must be -' 'Mr John Turner!'"
"It was the hotel waiter, opening the door."
"He showed a visitor into the room."
"The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure."
"His face was white and his lips tinged with blue."
"As a doctor I could see that he was a very ill man."
"Tray take a seat,' said Holmes."
"You said you wished to see me here to avoid scandal.'"
"The old man sunk his face in his hands."
"I would not have let that young man come to harm.'"
"Your daughter invited me here and I am acting in her interests."
"Young McCarthy must be got off, however.'"
"Yet I would sooner die under my own roof than in jail.'"
"You will sign it with Watson as witness."

"You can have the keeping of us."

"It seemed a great stroke to him to marry his son to my girl."
"I was ill and when I died his family would take the whole property."
"I would not do it."
"I braved him to do his worst."
"I smoked a cigar and waited in the trees till he was alone."
"I had to silence his foul tongue!"

"There are about 250 species, or types, of marsupials."
"Most live in Australia and its nearby islands."
"Seeing Colors How exactly do these marsupials see?"
"Color vision depends on cones."
"Cones are tiny cells in the retina that react to light."
"The retina is the lining in the back of the eye."
"It connects to the brain."
"Marsupials have three types of cones in their eyes."
"That leaves them unable to see blues or reds."
"The Land Down Under Leigh Haeger Australia is home to most marsupials."

"Primates, such as humans and apes, also have two types of cones."
"How Do We See?"
"Leigh Haeger Thanks to light, you can see."
"Light reflects, or bounces, off objects and travels to your eyes."
"Light enters the eye through the pupil."
"The pupil is the black circle in the middle of the eye."
"After entering the pupil, light passes through the lens."
"The retina has two types of light-sensitive cells."
"Rods detect black and white."
"The retina turns the light image into electrical signals."
"Those signals travel to the brain through the optic nerve."
"The brain then turns the image right side up."

"It's coming from the cellar,"" replied Jack, holding his nose."
"It smells like something's died."
"Maybe there's another rat."
"I'll check it out in the morning."

"It was the police."
"Can I come with you?"
"His dad checked his watch."
"It's getting late."
"I don't know how long I'm going to be."

"Finally Mai picks William."
"They walk out on to the pitch."
"Mai is next to William."
"I thought we were friends?"
"MAI It has nothing to do with friendship, Will."
"This has to do with winning."
"You even picked Ajay over me."
"And he has asthma!"
"MAI He still scored more goals than you in the last match we played."
"Will you go in goal?"
"Do I have to?"
"MAI Please, Will."
"William stomps over to the goal."
"Mr Crosby blows a whistle and the game starts."
"William is in goal."
"We see him miss several shots as he dives out of the way."
"He keeps slipping over in the mud in his trainers."
"He quickly gets covered in dirt."
"Finally, Kevin takes a shot."
"He doesn't get up."
"Mai and his team run over, looking worried."
"William walks in through his front door."
"There is no answer, so William goes into the lounge."

"Sasha blows a party blower."
"All (except William) Surprise!"
"The dog starts barking."
"DAD Happy birthday, son."
"MUM Bet you thought we'd forgotten didn't you?"

"He takes a sip of drink from a cup on the table."
"I'll be laughed at!"
"Of course I don't believe him."
"But I know it will make Grandad happy if he thinks I do."
"William tries the boots on."
"He wiggles his toes, then lifts one foot then the other."
"And I'm sure it's not pins and needles."
"I want to try them out."
"I mean, if that's OK?"
"MUM (off screen) Just for an hour then."
"And take the dog!"
"He is in his football kit and his new/old boots."
"He is holding a football."
"The dog is sitting watching him."

"MAI Sorry, Will."
"Mai looks at William's feet."
"Kevin, who has overheard their conversation, also looks at William's feet."
"Call them new boots, Sparks?"
"They look like they were made from bits of road kill."
"Trust you to have second-hand boots."
"AJAY Shut up, Kevin."
"Kevin squares up to them."
"What are you going to do about it, puffa boy?"
"They take their positions."
"Mai gives William a big smile."
"Then Ajay takes a puff on his inhaler."
"He has to stop."
"Mr Crosby blows the whistle and goes over to Ajay."
"William and Mai also run over."
"AJAY Think I just need to sit down, sir."
"Why don't you move William up?"

"They must be miracle boots or something."
"I mean you know how badly I played before."
"AJAY Yeah, but miracle boots!"

"They're very close!"
"We should be OK,"" Max whispered back."
"As long as we stay still."
"After a few moments Tiger hissed, ""Please hurry up ..."
"I've got to move soon."
"The four friends unfroze and quickly ducked behind the seats to hide."
"What do we do now?"
"It would be a disaster if they saw us micro-sized."
"Well, we can stay here for now"" said Max."
"We'll be able to escape when they leave."
"I like it..."" grinned Tiger."
"I've always wanted to be an astronaut."

"Now I understand what they mean by g-force!"
"Hey, those meteoroids are a bit close."
"They all winced and ducked as the spaceship whizzed through the shower of meteoroids."
"Hey, I've got an idea!"
"Why don't we really pretend to be the crew?"
"Let's do it,"" said Max."
"Come on,"" said Cat."
"We need to get the spacesuits from the dummies quickly."
"They just managed to pull the spacesuits on and hide the dummies in time."
"The spaceship came down with a BUMP!"
"OK, everybody, remember you're not real people,"" Max whispered."
"And that we're doing this to help Aunt Aisha,"" said Ant."
"Got it, Tiger?"
"Tiger was the best at pretending."
"Then he slowly turned round to the others and gave them a big grin."
"That's a small step for a boy"" he whispered."
"But it's one giant leap for Tiger!"
"We all need to move slowly!"
"They set up the scientific equipment round the spaceship."
"I think its working, Ant!"
"She nodded in the direction of the glass wall."
"The boss from SuperCorp definitely looks very impressed."
"Ant took a quick peek at the grown-ups."
"The boss was staring keenly at the display."
"That's amazing they heard him say."
"Suddenly the children heard the humming noise again."
"Quick, everyone - we'd better get back on board."
"Once again the spaceship shook and juddered as they dodged meteoroids."
"Soon the blue and green land of Earth came into view."
"I don't want to worry anyone,"" said Cat."
"But aren't we moving too fast?"
"Er ... yes, we are!"
"At this speed we'll crash!"
"And that will ruin everything!"
"We have to slow down."
"I'll take control!"
"I cant move the lever."
"For a moment the spaceship continued to pick up speed."
"Max took a deep breath and pulled hard on the lever again."
"With a long creak the lever finally began to move."
"Come on, come on ... slow down!"
"They touched down and the engines switched off."
"Great job, Max!"

"He tipped the box on to a table."

"To fit the ears on, of course,"" said Dad."
"All that stuff is really old,"" explained Dad."
"It belonged to a zoo keeper who once worked here."
"He believed in ear language."
"Look in the little blue book,"" said Dad."
"Eric opened the book."
"Giraffe Talk, it said."
"Three twitches with the left ear means: These flies are annoying me."
"Eric turned to the next page."
"I get it,"" said Eric, getting excited."
"This zoo keeper thought animals talked to each other by moving their ears?"
"That's right,"" said Dad."
"And he thought he could talk ear language too!"
"If he put on this cap!"
"He picked up the silly cap and fitted elephant ears on to it."
"He pulled it on his head."
"What are these strings for?"
"To make the ears move, of course."
"Eric pulled a few strings."
"I can't see."
"Are my ears moving?"
"They sure are,"" laughed Dad."
"Those elephant lugs are flapping like mad!"
"Now I can talk to the zoo animals,"" said Eric, thrilled."
"After I've practised a bit."
"I bet it doesn't work."
"It's a crazy idea."
"Oh,"" said Eric, dreadfully disappointed."
"Shall I just throw them away then?"
"Might as well,"" shrugged Dad."
"But Eric didn't throw anything away."
"Then he took the box home with him."
"Then he went with Dad to the zoo."
"It might work,"" thought Eric."
"At the zoo, Dad went off to feed the monkeys."
"Now,"" murmured Eric, ""who shall I talk to first?"
"He began wandering round the zoo."
"He felt very nervous."
"Lots of the animals were big and fierce and wild."
"Would they want to talk to a small, weedy human?"
"The giraffes looked haughty."
"The lions were scary."
"The polar bears were asleep."
"At last, he stopped outside the elephant pen."
"He put on the cap."
"He fitted on the big, flappy elephant ears."
"What shall I say first?"
"He gave his ears four twists and two waggles."
"The elephants took no notice."
"They carried on chewing leaves."
"Dad's right,"" thought Eric, sadly."
"This ear language is rubbish!"
"He gave it one more try."
"None of the big elephants waggled ""Hello!"
"Then two baby elephants wandered up to the fence."
"They were called Maya and Miko."
"Maya began waggling her ears."
"Three flaps, two left ear waggles."
"Does that mean anything?"
"He hardly dared to hope."
"He looked it up in his little blue book."
"Yes, it does!"
"An elephant is actually talking to me!"
"What is outside the big gates?"
"Maya was asking him."
"Does she mean outside the zoo?"
"He looked at the little blue book."
"It was a very hard question to answer."
"Ear language had no words for cars or crowds or busy roads."
"There was a quiet little park just outside the zoo gates."
"But there was no word for 'park' in ear language, either."
"Maya was getting impatient."
"Ah, here's something!"
"He'd found a word."
"It wasn't right, but it would have to do."
"Flap, flap went his ears."
"There is a jungle outside the big gates/1 Eric told the baby elephants."
"Maya waved her trunk in surprise."
"The jungle is so close?"
"Yes,"" answered Eric."
"He thought of the little park."
"It wasn't exactly a jungle."
"But it did have a few trees."
"And Maya was never going to find out."
"She was a zoo animal."
"She was never going to go outside."
"I have heard about the jungle,"" Miko's ears told him."
"I, too,"" waggled Maya."
"The old elephants tell us stories."
"The jungle is a wonderful place."
"What are they saying?"
"He couldn't keep up."
"Their ears were flapping so fast they were just a blur."
"Maya and Miko rushed off, still talking ear language."
"They seemed really excited."
"Maybe it's because they talked to a human for the first time!"
"He felt much more confident now."
"He felt like having a chat with the hyenas."
"The hyenas told jokes about visitors."
"They laughed at them all the time."
"Look at that silly man."
"His face is as red as a baboon's bottom!"
"Eric talked with the timid gazelles, next."
"They seemed to worry a lot."
"They might eat us all up!"
"He even dared to have a word with the lions."
"They seemed very keen to invite him inside their cages."
"Come closer, human child!"
"His eyes glittered greedily."
"Come closer, so I may smell you."
"Er, sorry, I haven't got time,"" Eric told him."
"I'm just off to see some potbellied pigs."
"I adore pigs,"" the lion replied, licking his lips."
"It's brilliant fun!"
"He felt as if he'd been talking ear language all his life!"
"Chapter 3 What's Going On?"
"Then, soon after, something strange happened at the zoo."
"The gazelles were skipping about."
"The hyenas were running round in mad circles."
"Why are they all so excited?"
"He headed for the elephant pen."
"He had to ask Maya and Miko about it."
"He fixed on his elephant ears."
"Two flicks and a waggle meant: ""What's going on?"
"But Maya and Miko didn't run up to greet him."
"Maya and Miko were far away at the other side of their pen."
"Their grey ears seemed busy."
"They had lots to say."
"But they were talking to the kangaroos over the fence, not to him."
"Eric felt rather left out."
"He watched their ears."
"He could keep up now, no matter how fast they moved."
"Don't be silly,"" Maya was telling the kangaroos."
"We elephants can't jump."
"We will all find our own way out."
"The kangaroos can jump fences, the hyenas can dig under them."
"The elephants will use their strength to push the fences down!"
"The jungle the human child told us about."
"We will all be free!"
"As Eric watched, he felt his heart grow cold."
"He suddenly realized what they were up to."
"The animals were planning a mass break-out!"
"And it was all because of him."
"He hadn't used the right words."
"He'd told them there was a jungle outside the zoo."
"There were motorways out there."
"The animals would get run over."
"And where would they find food?"
"There were no keepers to feed them outside the gates."
"I can't believe this is happening!"
"He had to find out more."
"He felt like a spy."
"We will escape today!"
"Like Chinese whispers, the message spread all round the zoo."
"And there was nothing he could do to stop it."
"Eric could hear the whoops as the monkeys got it."
"Then the roar as it reached the lions."
"Soon, the whole zoo was buzzing with news of the mass break-out."
"Suddenly, Maya saw Eric."
"Hello, human child!"
"Did you hear what we said?"
"Yes,"" admitted Eric."
"He didn't want to lie to the animals."
"They thought he was their friend."
"Chapter 4 ""You Told us the Truth?"
"We are very grateful to you!"
"You told us the truth."
"The jungle is so close!"
"We cannot wait to get there."
"It is our dream!"
"Eric took hold of the strings that worked his elephant ears."
"He wanted to waggle, ""There is no jungle!"
"You don't understand!"
"It will be terrible out there."
"You could all die!"
"But he just couldn't do it."
"He couldn't spoil the animals' dreams."
"He let his hands drop."
"What is that kangaroo asking us?"
"I can't quite see."
"Miko squinted through the fence with his tiny elephant eyes."
"He is asking, 'Does the human child know about our plans?"
"What if he tells the keepers?"
"They will stop our escape!'"
"His ears flapped furiously."
"We can trust the human child!"
"He is on our side!"
"Eric trudged away from the elephant pen."
"His mind was in torment."
"What on earth was he going to do?"
"Dreadful thoughts were growing like monsters in his brain."
"He'd only thought about the animals, up to now."
"He hadn't thought about the danger to humans."
"What if the lions escaped?"
"I'm going to have to tell!"
"I'm going to have to!"
"He set off to find Dad."
"He was still struggling to make up his mind."
"He passed the gazelles."
"They were skipping about in a frenzy."
"Their ears flickered, ""We are going outside to the jungle."
"Oh, no,"" groaned Eric."
"What if they get hit by cars?"
"What if they meet the crocodiles?"
"It was no good."
"He couldn't wriggle out of it any longer."
"He pushed open the door to the keepers' room."
"He knew Dad would be having his tea break."
"Dad,"" he said, in a small shaky voice."
"I've got something really important to tell you."
"At first, Dad didn't believe him."
"He kept saying, ""This is a joke, isn't it?"
"Two gazelles and a kangaroo have just jumped over the fence!"
"Then Dad began to believe it."
"Call out all the keepers!"
"This is an emergency!"
"The animals' escape was over before it began."
"The keepers saw to that."
"The two gazelles and the kangaroo were put back in their pens."
"As the kangaroo was led back, he saw Eric standing with the keepers."
"His ears started waggling."
"The first gazelle twitched her ears angrily."
"You did it so humans wouldn't get hurt."
"You had to tell!"
"The keepers thought he was a hero."
"But that didn't make him feel any better."
"The animals thought he was a big sneak."
"Eric felt really upset about that."
"Chapter 6 Rabbit Talk At home, Eric stood by the dustbin."
"I'm going to throw this ear language stuff away,"" he decided."
"None of the animals would ever speak to him again."
"And, anyway, it had caused nothing but trouble."
"He threw the elephant ears into the bin."
"Then the gazelle ears."
"Then all the other ears."
"They were long and floppy."
"They were white and silky."
"Wait a minute, I know!"
"He'd meant to throw everything away."
"But, instead, he ran down to the end of the garden."
"Fluffy, his pet rabbit, was out in her run."
"Eric searched through the little blue book."
"He found the page headed Rabbit Talk."
"He just couldn't stop himself."
"He fitted the ears on to the hat."
"He put the hat on his head."
"Three waggles and two flicks meant, ""What is your favourite food?"
"Dandelions,"" Fluffy told him, blinking her pink eyes."
"And what do you like doing best?"
"Sunbathing,"" answered Fluffy."
"At least I've still got one animal to talk to!"
"But I've had enough excitement for one day,"" thought Eric."

"Welcome to this IMF press conference on the AsiaPacific Region."
"My name is Ting Yan."
"Andwe have three deputy directors here."
"MR. RHEE: Thank you, Ting."
"And good evening in Asia again."
"So let's start withour key messages."
"Regionaloutput is projected to grow by 5.6 percent in 2018 and 2019."
"That is about4.1 percent percentage point higher than we expected in October."
"This overthe region was supported by external demand as well as accommodativefinancial conditions."
"Third, Asia has enjoyed relatively subdued inflation even the growth hasbeen picking up."
"But policymakers should not be complacent."
"So let me expand on these points before we turnto your questions."
"So let's move on to the risk factors."
"And geopolitical tensions could have seriousrepercussions on financial market and on the real economy."
"Asia risks becoming old before becoming rich."
"Asia alsoexperiences a significant productivity growth slowdown since the globalfinancial crisis."
"Let me move to the policy recommendations."
"Against this backdrop, policyshould aim to strengthen buffers, increase resilience and ensuresustainability."
"Subdued inflation provides scope for accommodative monetary policy stancein much of Asia."
"So let me reiterate our key message before concluding."
"And the region faces seriousstructural challenges over the longer term."
"And policy making shouldbe prudent and focus on increasing resilience."
"Now let's turn toyour questions."
"MS. YAN: Thank you."
"Please identify yourself before you ask questions andwe will take a few questions together."
"IMF raised the WorldEconomic Outlook projection to 3.9 percent this year and next year."
"That is0.2 percent higher than that of October."
"Sowould you elaborate more on this?"
"Is Asia region sort of losing momentum atthis moment?"
"Let's take a couple more."
"Why does thiskind of thinking happen, can you explain a little bit?"
"And finally, in south Asia, Bangladesh is the second fastest growingeconomy."
"So Asia as a whole growth outlook was also revised upward by over 0.1percent."
"Actually if you look at China, the growth ratein 2017 was 6.9 percent."
"Sowe and so India's growth rate has picked up too."
"So I will think it is a very positive development."
"That has benefited incomes both inthose producing countries but also consumers in consumption countries."
"But we areexpecting a further gradual decline to.9 percent growth next year."
"But,again, this is a natural evolution."
"The surprise was actually on the upside."
"And so I think we expect and hope that the reform momentum continues."
"Butyou are right, looking ahead there are important policy priorities."
"Andhere I would just highlight a few."
"So there is roomto do more on trade reform."
"I think your last question was on the outlook for Bangladesh."
"MR. RHEE: Let me clarify one thing."
"We are not saying that India'sstructural reform speed will slow down because of elections."
"So there is somethingmisquoted."
"Let's take a few more questions."
"The lady in the frontrow."
"MS. YAN: And the gentleman in the second row here."
"So how accurate is this assessment?"
"And my second question has to do with the commodity market."
"My question is, how about the forecast of IMF ofIndonesia?"
"China has donevery well in 2017."
"But overall the future for the Chineseeconomy continues to be bright in our review."
"There is room for furthercatch up and productivity gains."
"So we see a lot of upside there."
"On the downside there are obvious risks both from the global economy."
"The main risks inChina really are medium-term."
"It relates to the reforms that are on theagenda."
"These reforms are under way."
"What's the risk of the spillovers from global financial tightening toChina?"
"Mongolia program is now one year old."
"It was approved almost exactly a yearago."
"Of course, a program like that is a live animal."
"It always has to respondto different circumstances and domestic pressures and so forth."
"The next step of the banking reformis a big step."
"I think it's overall a good story."
"How dependent is Mongolia on the commodity outlook?"
"Obviously they are verydependent."
"I think fiscalpolicy is appropriately geared toward rebuilding fiscal buffers."
"Gentleman in the first row."
"A question for Odd Per Brekk, please."
"My question is on the geopolitical factor."
"They started their talks under the water."
"How is theprogress of -- the denuclearization progress?"
"And I have two questions on that."
"It is verycritical to North Korea maybe."
"What kind of policy do you have?"
"Letâs take one more."
"The lady in the fourth row here,thank you."
"IMF upgraded the US economic outlook mainly becauseof tax reform."
"What are your thoughts onthis?"
"The inflation numbers for March came outtoday."
"This is happening despite theentrenched expectations and structural rigidities."
"So the second point is Abenomics has beendelivering results."
"Weâre now looking forward to the legislationbeing passed in the Diet."
"Second element, coordinated demand and the incomepolicies."
"In that regard, we look forward to the outcome of the ongoingfiscal review."
"We should expect to see by the middle of this year."
"Obviously theNorth Korean situation was one of those risks."
"MR. RHEE: More specifications about what IMF can be doing."
"Our majorstakeholders have an agreement that there are many ways that we can beengaged."
"As for the growth impact, actually we did some simulations."
"Definitely, now the U.S. nominal tax rate isreduced to 21 percent."
"On the other hand, the U.S. has its own state tax around 6percent."
"Europe has more than half, Asia isaround 16 percent and 20 percent."
"Let me turn to our online media center."
"Weâve got manyquestions."
"Let me take one here."
"This is a question on Nepal."
"Balance ofpayment is slipping into deficit."
"Growth likely through average in 2018.What needs to be done to improve?"
"Once again, let me ask a question about trade."
"A lotof people are talking about tension between the United States and China."
"Whatkind of concrete proposal would you like to make."
"MR. RHEE: I think this week we have repeated our messages."
"Because Asia has benefited a lot by global trading system."
"The recommendations are quitespecific to each country."
"Relying on the more flexible exchange rate system is anotherrecommendation."
"That can actually contribute to this kind of tradetension globally."
"Please stay tuned and with that, letme conclude this press conference."
