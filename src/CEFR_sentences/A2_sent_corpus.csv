"Now,"" continued Milton Grizzlefur."

"Good luck,"" said Milton Grizzlefur."

"Dad,"" I whispered, ""I've just had a thought."
"Where do humans keep their clothes?"
"How do I know?"
"He was still cross about his tail."
"Fur has always been good enough for me."
"What about in here?"
"I pulled open a likely looking door."
"A light came on."
"I jumped into the air and landed on a table."
"Dad sighed and gently shut the door."
"That, Sandy, is called a fridge."
"Humans keep their food in it."
"I think we have to look upstairs."
"We went along the hall and up the stairs."
"I can hear Mr Otterbank snoring,"" I giggled."
"Now, this is called a bedroom -"" We went inside."
"Mr and Mrs Otterbank were two big lumps in a bed."
"Some clothes were on a chair, and we grabbed them."
"There must be more somewhere,"" said Dad."
"Look in those drawers."
"They pull out, so be careful."
"Then Dad went to search in the children's room."
"I opened a window and threw out everything we had into the garden."
"Do purple and orange go together?"
"And, ""Paws off!"

"Everyone was busily turning up cuffs and trousers."

"You little monkeys, do up those buttons."
"And for heaven's sake stop chewing them."
"Are we ready to face what lies outside Monkey Land?"
"Then off we go."
"I even let Jem hold my paw."
"We saw we were on the edge of a big town."
"And we'll go in different directions."
"Watch out for traffic."
"Cars go much, much faster outside Monkey Land."
"And above all things, remember to behave like a human."

"Everyone be back here an hour before sunrise."

"Mum and Dad gripped our paws for safety."
"Milton Grizzlefur was right about the traffic."
"It zoomed along faster than a charging rhino."
"There was so much to see."
"Just then, Mum was telling us about something called a lettuce box."
"Look, Otis, humans!"
"Don't panic, dear,"" said Dad."
"It'll be all right."
"Some humans went by."
"They looked at us strangely."
"And they must be sweltering in those heavy clothes,"" said another."
"They turned a corner and we all burst out laughing."
"That was close,"" said Dad."
"Let's walk on the other side of the road."
"It's not so brightly lit."
"As we were crossing the road, a dirty white van shot into view."
"We jumped for our lives."
"The van just missed us."
"Dad went absolutely ape!"
"You could have killed us."
"For goodness sake, Otis!"
"Remember what Milton said."
"The white van had screeched to a halt and was reversing back."
"Chapter 5 Smelly and Fogg Dad should never have lost his temper like that."

"Mum and Dad huddled together with Jem and me in the middle."
"The tall human was very smart."
"He wore a flower in his button hole."
"The short one smelt like - well, not very nice."
"He was called Chas Smeelly."
"Well, Chas,"" said Bantam Fogg."
"Well, Mr Fogg,"" said Chas Smeelly."
"His hand flew out and snatched off Dad's hat."
"Just as we thought, Mr Fogg."
"Monkeys, Chas, monkeys,"" corrected Bantam Fogg."
"From that Monkey Land place, no doubt."
"But these are no ordinary monkeys, Chas."
"Pretending to be humans ..."
"I expect they can understand what we say, too."
"You'd best open the van doors, Chas."
"Chas Smeelly grinned as he opened the doors."
"Doors opened, Mr Fogg,"" he said."
"You're coming with us."
"There's a little job I want you to do."
"And we climbed inside the van, feeling very small and very frightened."
"It was very bumpy."
"Chas Smeelly drove fast and said a lot of bad words about other drivers."
"Then the van slowed right down."
"Chas Smeelly turned off the engine and Bantam Fogg looked back at us."
"His smile was as friendly as a shark's."
"Now listen, you monkey chaps,"" he said, smiling."
"I want you two big monkeys to do a job for us."
"Here's what I want you to do."
"This is Hambone Hall, a big house full of lovely expensive things."
"I want you to climb up and get in through the top window."
"Then I want you to start collecting up some of those lovely things."
"We'll be waiting here, ready to fill our sacks."
"Chas Smeelly turned around and the smell of him seemed to get stronger."
"Mum looked at Dad."
"But this was proper burglary."
"Chas Smeelly and Bantam Fogg meant to keep everything for themselves."
"Poor Mum and Dad."
"There was nothing they could do about it."
"The van doors opened, and they slowly climbed out."
"We'll be back soon,"" said Mum."
"She looked so worried."
"Then they were gone."
"Quiet in there,"" hissed Chas Smeelly."
"Or I'll make you two into a pair of furry mittens!"
"We saw Dad and Mum take off their shoes."
"Then they began to climb up a drainpipe."
"After that, I couldn't bear to look."
"Don't do that!"
"Look -"" I pointed with my paw."
"It's a key,"" said Jem."
"Haven't keys got us into enough trouble tonight?"
"But that's not a door key,"" I said."
"It's a key to start up the engine."
"I know because I've watched humans in the car park."
"If we can drive this thing, we can go and get help."
"And you reckon you can drive it?"
"Jem asked, excitedly."
"I said, even though I wasn't really that sure."
"I couldn't see out of the windscreen."
"Jem would have to give me directions."
"I explained to Jem how the pedals worked."
"Brake ... accelerator,"" she repeated."
"It was crowded in the driving seat."
"I suppose so,"" she said."
"I turned the key."
"The engine came alive."
"I shouted at Jem."
"Suddenly we were rushing forward."
"Outside, I could hear Bantam Fogg and Chas Smeelly snarling."
"Their running feet crunched on the gravel as they chased after us."
"We hit a statue and knocked off its head."
"Which way, Jem?"
"A different statue lost both its arms."
"Sorry, I meant right."
"Luckily, we had left Bantam Fogg and Chas Smeelly far behind."
"After a mile or two, Jem and I became much better."
"A team, you might say."
"I began to feel proud of myself."
"Certainly, that was what it looked like to PC Duffle."
"He was parked in a side street, eating a sandwich."
"Following the signs, we came in sight of Monkey Land."
"We went right through the gates and ended up outside Mr Otterbank's house."
"A light went on."
"A window flew open."
"And Mr Otterbank's head poked out."
"Blow me - Sandy and Jem have just climbed out."
"Let me see ... HELP!"
"Mum and Dad prisoners at Hambone Hall."
"I'd better go and see what this is all about."
"It was then that he discovered all of his clothes had gone."
"Every drawer and cupboard empty!"
"Luckily, Mrs Otterbank remembered there was something he could wear."
"It's only me,"" said Mr Otterbank's muffled voice."
"Quickly, back inside the van, both of you."
"No, I'll drive now, if you don't mind."
"He reversed the van past the shattered gates and we were off again."
"Meanwhile, PC Duffle had finished his sandwich and was eating an iced bun."
"Hmm,"" he thought."
"I'll look more carefully this time."
"And so he did."
"That's all right,"" he said with a sigh of relief."
"A second later, a half-eaten iced bun was tossed aside."
"Blue lights flashed and a siren wailed."
"I tugged at Mr Otterbank's sleeve."
"Mr Otterbank glanced in the mirror."
"In the headlights, we saw Bantam Fogg and Chas Smeelly."
"Mum and Dad were filling open sacks with treasure from the house."
"Hold it right there!"
"A big fight started: gorilla and monkeys against burglars."
"And then PC Duffle arrived."
"He climbed out of his patrol car looking very confused."
"He decided to arrest the gorilla for speeding."
"That was too much for PC Duffle."
"He was so shocked that he fainted."
"Outnumbered now five to two, Bantam Fogg and Chas Smeelly were quickly defeated."
"Ever been made a monkey of?"
"Chas Smeelly used some more of his bad words."
"He really did know quite a few."
"They use innocent monkeys as burglars."
"Me and Jem put the treasure nearby for evidence."
"Nobody had to be told twice."
"We jumped into the van, and Mr Otterbank drove off."
"He didn't say much as he drove."
"It seemed like he was busy thinking."
"He stopped outside his house and turned to Dad."
"Otis,"" he said, ""I am going back to bed."
"Please make sure that all the things you borrowed are left on my doorstep."
"And the keys, too."
"And he went inside."
"Well,"" said Mum surprised."
"I thought he'd be more cross than that."
"But for the monkeys there were a lot of stories to be swapped."
"And everyone wondered what Mr Otterbank would do."
"Clifton Moke said he expected Mr Otterbank would build an electric fence."
"But I knew Mr Otterbank wasn't like that at all."

"Everyone gathered at the tyre tree."
"At last he began to speak."
"Mr Otterbank is the best human who ever lived,"" he told us."
"He realizes we are not ordinary monkeys."
"But listen to me, monkeys."
"We have to be much more careful in future."
"You can say that again,"" I muttered."
